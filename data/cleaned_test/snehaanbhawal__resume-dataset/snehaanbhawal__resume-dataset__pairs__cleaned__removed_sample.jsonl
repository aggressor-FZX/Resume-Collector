Lead Electrical Engineer 05/2005 to 08/2008 Company Name City , State Led electrical engineering for the design, development, manufacturing and delivery of ten military flight simulators for the US Air Force and two flight simulators for Singapore. Team was able to complete electrical engineering tasks ahead of schedule and under budget. Initiated the lean practice of performing hardware checkout in the final phase of manufacturing instead of waiting for manufacturing turnover. This practice resulted in a schedule savings of three weeks per flight simulator. Validated electrical engineering drawings met the requirements and were compliant with our drawing standards. Supervised the installation of numerous flight simulators throughout the United States, United Kingdom and South Korea. Electrical Engineer 11/2001 to 05/2005 Designed electrical systems to be integrated in military flight simulators. These systems included AC/DC power distribution, video distribution, control loaders and communication systems. Designed wire harnesses for military flight simulators. This effort consisted of specifying the components, wire and connector sizing, and interfaces. Developed design specifications, schematics and assembly drawings for the manufacturing of military flight simulators. Played an integral part in the production of the first high fidelity F-15 flight simulator based on an architecture consisting of personal computers. Initiated the trade study to utilize commercially available uninterruptible power supplies instead of custom designed power distribution systems to provide power to simulators. Resulted in a cost savings of $150,000 per training facility.

{"reason": "cap_exceeded", "input": "\"EDUCATION OFFICER & SENIOR EDUCATION OFFICER GUIDANCE & COUNSELING UNIT Professional Summary I joined the Ministry of Education in 1982 and was posted at the R.M.Bailey Senior High School where I remained for seventeen and a half wonderful years. I served as Head of the Guidance Department from 1991 to 1999 until my redeployment to Special Services Section to oversee the Guidance & Counseling Unit upon the retirement of the former officer. I enjoyed my experience at R.M.Baily and have had the pleasure of working with and assisting students even after my departure from the school, I am still counseling many of them and their children today. I have had the opportunity of supervising the Guidance & Counseling Unit over the past sixteen years and watched it grow from forty- two (42) counselors in 1999 to one hundred and thirty two (132) in 2015, posted in ninety-four schools on fourteen islands and cays throughout the country. During my leadership, we collaborated with the College of The Bahamas and Kent State University and established a Master's of Education Degree Program in School Counseling from 2001 to 2011. Eighty- nine (89) persons obtained the Masters Degree, and the unit has the largest amount of employees with this Degree in the Ministry of Education. I realized in order for the unit to move forward, ongoing training was a requirement for all officers, which kept them informed about the latest techniques and strengthened areas of concern. We also established a crisis team that assists with grief and disaster counseling. The needs of students were being met but those of the employees were not and after visiting the school district in Dallas Texas, I learned about the Employee Assistance Program, and implemented it at the Ministry of Education on a smaller scale. This proved to be very successful but the need for expansion was necessary. Upon the retirement of Mrs. Pansy Hamilton Brown, Iris Strachan, and Clevette Gibson took the reins and took EAP to the next level. The demands on the officers made me realize that the service needed to be made available to all government employees and the idea to expand the service was decided. I enjoyed my role as Senior Education Officer and if given the opportunity would like to be a part of taking EAP to the next level.
