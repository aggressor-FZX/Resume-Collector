What's been slowing her down in translating her knowledge and notes into copy that really feels like it flows and 'goes in' without friction or burning too much glucose on the writers behalf.A challenge that has presented itself is that while my partner is a great speaker, she does also struggle with dyslexia and sometimes her 'spoken' style doesn't translate perfectly onto the written page.So in trying to help her, I began searching on upwork, and came across the term 'line editor' which sounds exactly like what she needs right now to create more flow in the process.With the book draft deadline approaching in a few weeks, it would be amazing to get some skilled assistance to help perfect her work to hand to Penguins editing team, and reduce the friction so she can last the distance and feel proud and supported along the way.To see if you'd be a great fit and feel comfortable with the project, I'd love to propose sending over a sample chapter of hers in the rough, which you could edit to your hearts content. We can then expand the scope to the entire work from there if everything feels in alignment, both on your side as well as hers.In your response I'd also love to know if the field of meditation / mental health / manifestation / self-help is something you have interest, passion or experience in.Please let me know if you might have capacity and feel drawn to the project, and I can setup a contract so we can give it a test for a few hours of your time to begin.Looking forward to chatting further with the ideal candiate.Best wishesChrisPosted On: February 14, 2024 00:54 UTCCategory: Copy EditingSkills:WritingSkills: WritingCountry: Germany\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hey, there, currently-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

The app promises a convenient, fast, and user-friendly experience, enabling students to avoid long lines and wait times, especially during peak hours. Our mission is to enhance the social and dining experience through technology.Design Objectives:Modern and Youthful: The logo should reflect a modern, energetic, and youthful vibe that resonates with college students. It should be fresh, and vibrant, and convey a sense of fun and excitement.Memorable and Unique: The design must be distinctive and memorable, easily recognizable on a small app icon. It should stand out in a crowded app marketplace.Versatile: The logo should be versatile enough to be used across various platforms and materials, including digital (app icon, website, social media) and physical (promotional materials, merchandise).Theme: Incorporate elements that suggest the nature of the app (ordering, bars, college life) subtly and creatively. This could involve integrating symbols like a glass, cocktail, a smartphone, or college imagery, but in a unique manner that avoids clichés.Color Scheme: We're open to suggestions but lean towards a color palette that is appealing to the young audience, possibly incorporating vibrant but not overwhelming colors. Consider using colors that evoke feelings of energy, socializing, and fun.

Specifically I need the lighting and shadows to be soft product shadows and the eventual imagery to be good enough to be used as a product shot in an Amazon or ebay listing. Performance can be sacrificed for quality of render.The shot must be set up by the user then a button would be available to capture the current frame of the canvas as an image.The project should be delivered in react / vite or whichever system you use. Specificallly using react-three/drei and GLB/GTLF meshes imported locally. The pouches must be filled with capsules or pills. I have created this already but happy for you to recreate this if you think there is an easier way to achieve this. In summary:- a react app using react-three/drei (i already have some working code)- a product shot of a filled pouch with soft shadows on a blank background with orbit controls- the contents of the pouch must be dynamically set via a url parameter (e.g ?contents=pills or ?contents=capsules)- dynamically set front and back png images, set with a url parameter (e.g. ?front=front_image.png&back=back.png)- the ability to use a button capture and save the canvas as an image with the resolution of 2000x2000Can you give me a price and an estimate of time for this work please?

It will also require a search section where the subscriber can search for certain values such as a particular number, name ect.

Include functionality to highlight potential reversals following pivot point confirmation and specify trade entry points at the breakout or breakdown levels, incorporating divergence rules for additional confirmation.#### Algorithmic Trading Logic**Understanding Market Structure**- Code algorithms to identify and classify market trends: uptrends (HH and HL), downtrends (LL and LH), and sideways trends (flat highs and lows).**Trade Entries and Exits**- **Uptrends**: Code buy entries on retracements to HL with exits targeting HH, placing stop losses below the recent HL.- **Downtrends**: Initiate shorts on pullbacks to LH, targeting LL with stop losses set above the LH.- **Sideways Trends**: Enable trades between support and resistance, setting stop losses outside the range to minimize risk.- **Breakouts and Breakdowns**: Implement trade entries at the point of breakout or breakdown, with stops placed just outside the breakout/breakdown level to manage risk effectively. Divergence considerations should refine these entries, enhancing the strategy's precision.**Utilizing RSI for Trade Confirmation**- Employ RSI analysis to bolster trade entry and exit decisions, providing a multifaceted approach to market engagement.#### Risk Management- Implementation of a 3:1 minimum risk-reward ratio for all trades.- Inclusion of stop loss and target settings for comprehensive trade management.- The strategy is to be optimized for E-mini futures trading (ES, NQ), considering prop firm combine rules, including varying start funds and contract-based futures trading.### Development Specifications- **Platform Compatibility**: Aimed primarily for NinjaTrader with potential adaptability for other platforms.- **Optimization for Prop Firm Combine**: Strategy testing against Topstep's combine rules, focusing on risk management, starting funds, and trading objectives. There are 3 combines so user should be able to select the combine strategy in the settings of the indicator.- **Trade Management**: Features ensuring trades align with the predominant trend and mechanisms for pinpointing optimal entries and exits.### Deliverables1. **Custom Indicator**: A trading indicator developed according to the provided specifications.2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation on installation, configuration, and utilization of the indicator.3. **Testing Results**: A report analyzing the indicator's performance, especially regarding Topstep's combine requirements.#### ConclusionThis guide furnishes programmers with a detailed blueprint for developing a trading strategy indicator that fulfills the strategic and risk management criteria crucial for successful futures trading within the Topstep combine. Incorporating these elements ensures the creation of a sophisticated tool that not only automates market trend identification but also embeds stringent risk management protocols.**Optimization for Prop Firm Combine**- Integrate an option within the indicator settings for users to select their specific Topstep combine strategy, adjusting the trading parameters accordingly. This ensures the strategy's adaptability and facilitating trader success across different combine levels.Hourly Range: $30.00-$60.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 04:50 UTCCategory: Scripting & AutomationSkills:TradingView, Trading Automation, Trading Strategy, NinjaTrader, C#Skills: TradingView, Trading Automation, Trading Strategy, NinjaTrader, C#Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Automated Excel workflows using automation, pivot to create dashboards and custom macros, improving reporting speed and reducing manual effort for clients.

You can find them around the internet/github. You will need to get them running and test them to see that they are finding ALL relevant results for specific search queries and that new results can be found instantly (in 1 minute after an item is posted). If needed/they're not good enough you will refine the scraper to make it faster and more efficient. We are looking for a basic proof of concept for a scraper we can integrate with our mobile app to provide users with search alerts for these marketplaces. Each user will be running their own searches for different items. This means it needs to be very efficient. Please don't apply for this job if you are planning on showing us your own internet wide web crawler, we need something highly specific fast and economical for each site. Preferably via an api if there is one. You will need to try out the systems people have built and see what works best. Scrapers must avoid blocking if there is a risk of it. Consider 1000s of users will use these in the future. We need you to determine if we need proxies or if we can use free proxies. The system must be theoretically scalable to 1000s of users eventually with kubernetes.Milestone 1. Show us a working scraper for each marketplace that finds ALL new results in 1 minute.We will assess the quality of your work and determine whether its good enough to continue with the scrapers you have shown us. If they aren't good enough (slow inefficient get blocked will cost too much to run) then you will not proceed to milestone 2. We expect you to try out all the different methods you can find and pick the best one, not the first one you find.Milestone 2. ($Amount to be negotiated after milestone 1.)Integrate both scrapers into a django backend using a similar structure to our existing system for fb marketplace so that if we decide to integrate in the future we can. We will provide information on this on request.Extra details*Commit to our organisation GitHub when working on the project. run and test on a 2cpu linode with an internal postgres databse.There will need to be an app for each scraper.craigslist_scaper.py & offerup_scaper.py to keep it neat. The scrapers get called in tasks by periodic tasks. Code must be efficient, fast and reliable.This may lead onto regular work as backend dev for the Company if you display a commitment to excellence, a hard-working attitude and you work fast.

I would like to find someone in the US who can help me, as needed, with a variety of tasks:- We use Microsoft 365 Business Premium‎, which has tools that I'm unfamiliar with for security and user management. I would like someone to help me come up with an SOP for users (what are they allowed to do and install), and configure settings for optimal performance and security.- Our staff is each assigned a laptop. I set them up myself and can continue to do that. Our freelance sysadmin could help develop an SOP and settings for users (specifically security).- We use OneDrive to backup all files, and we are working on setting up a \"shared server\" with SharePoint to archive important files. I need someone to help me set up this system correctly, and help me connect this shared server to each user.- Users are fairly self sufficient, and hopefully the SOPs we create and the settings we use will increase their self sufficiency. However, there are occasions where a user has difficulty with their system and could use some technical support. I would love to have someone be able to help me troubleshoot users by connecting with them via Zoom and working through their problems.Basically, I just need someone who knows more than me, and can help me on occasion with IT-related things.
