My background is software engineering so I’m pretty slow at content creation and need someone who can work a bit more efficiently with less research time.The primary task is posing and animating two realistic human characters in limited poses and animations that don’t need to be super detailed. They are secondary characters to be added to a video recorded with actual humans on a green screen background.For those two characters, I have created MetaHumans for reference. If it’s easier to work with the MetaHumans directly by creating 3D animations then that’s fine, otherwise use them as the base images/videos to further edit with AI tools.Forewarning, the content of this project contains violence but is part of a larger comedic project.I need at the very least three modifications made to the MetaHumans (MH):1. MH #1 in some scenes needs a Santa hat (currently has no hat)2. MH #2 in some scenes needs to hold a pistol (currently has empty hands)3. MH #2 in some scenes will have a collar-like device around his neck (very simple can just look like a black tube of plastic if needed)Optionally, I’d prefer to also make them appear dirtier, maybe wearing tattered clothing.Then, I need the following poses / animations:- Sitting cross-legged on the floor, holding up head, asleep- Startled awake from a kick- A back view (face/hands obscured) of robbing someone, pointing gun at another character, gesturing with arms- A back view (face/hands obscured) of sitting cross-legged on floor, hunched over looking through stolen goods (animation only - no props)- ~20 seconds of nervously talking and gesturing with hands (low detail - will be mostly blocked by another character)- Few seconds of looking increasingly nervous- Slowly and nervously touching neck- Frantically clawing at neck while being strangled- Pointing gun in one hand, other hand at neck- Firing gun once from above pose- On knees / floor, dying - whatever works hereMost of these are just body animations but a few facial expressions will be needed. If any talking is visible on screen it’ll probably be easier just to use some AI lip-syncing tools (which I can do). I also have some image / video references for poses / animations.There’s a lot more I’d like to do as well but these are the main things I need first. If you can successfully accomplish these tasks, I’ll likely have others.Please respond with what you think is possible, to what degree of quality, your rough initial plan/tools for accomplishing it, and of course how long you think it’d take + cost. Feel free to also list any complimentary skills you have which may be useful for another project. Examples of work is a bonus.Note that I have a second listing up for this same project to be accomplished using traditional 3D models / animations (with maybe a little AI like DeepMotion) to compare the two approaches, however I will likely have other work available that requires this approach specifically so reach out either way and show me you’re familiar with the space and can get things done. Experience in both fields is a bonus.More details will be provided to qualified candidates.Thank you for your time.

On ‘GO’ the animal will sprint across and off the screen on the right side. Each animal at a different speed.The six animals will be:- Giraffe- Elephant- Ostrich- Lion- Bullfrog- Olympic sprinterEach of the animals will be on the same sprinting track (single track) and have standard sprinter’s starting blocks. (See [REDACTED_URL] The elephant can be shown as crushing the blocks when he steps in (very embarrassed). The Bullfrog will use only one of the two starting blocks. The Lion can roar once before the race. The Giraffe whose head would normally be out of the frame might bend over and look at the people watching. When running though, the giraffe's head is to lean forward to remain in the frame.Above the sprinting track the scenery will change with each animal, to show without too much detail, the animal’s natural habitat. We would like to have some minor motion in the background: something like a tree moving in the breeze, clouds moving, a bird or a butterfly passing innocently. The background does not move. It is fixed. Only the animal moves across the screen. The ‘camera’ does not pan at all.The background for the Olympic Sprinter is to be a huge sports stadium.The animals, would need to accelerate (going from standstill to their eventual speed) for the first .5 of a second and then their speed would be:- Giraffe - 36 feet per second (11 meters per second)- Elephant - 47 feet per second (14 meters per second)- Lion - 73 feet per second (22 meters per second)- Olympic sprinter - 30 feet per second (9 meters per second)- Bullfrog will be 6 inches (15 cm) in length.

Solr multi value search issue: When we search product in multi value field, it searches all the products keywords in all entities while as per our requirement it should search in separate entity.For Example: If we have two entities in single field \"leather bag\" and \"ladies bat,\" and try to search for \"leather AND bat\" it returns results from both entities, whereas it should not give any results.3. Spellcheck issue:- The solr search spellcheck does not provide the correct spelling when we search for \"Bamatirice\", it should automatically correct it to \"Basmati rice.\"- We are not able to implement 3 edit to correct spellcheck.

I have been living as a digital nomad and working in this field for the past few years and I now want to scale things up.As part of growing my business, I’d like to find reliable editors to work with. I want to grow in the industry and undertake more/bigger projects.Disclaimer: this isn’t going to be full time to begin with. In the long run I would love to be able to hire you, but at the moment I just need one or two freelancers to delegate work to.What I want from you:- Experience: I need you to have a track record in video editing and to be able to showcase previous projects. Preferably you work on the Adobe Suite, but if you use other softwares, we can always make do. You don’t need to work for Hollywood but I still need solid skills.- Flexibility: as I’m sure you know, some clients are harder to deal with or have very short deadlines. I would like someone who is ready to work on short notice and review their work if necessary.- Creativity: I would like someone who will find the little extra touch to stand out. UGC is everywhere and it is more important than ever to come up with new ideas to secure the most interesting partnerships.- Versatility: we will create for many different clients, so you will need to be able to adapt to any type of project, whether it is regarding the format or the topic. Usually it will be shorts etc., so feel free to show more of your fast-paces motion design videos.- Patience: I reiterate that this won’t be a straight line to a big salary, and some periods might be very empty. As a growing business we may have to accept unfavorable terms from time to time; so expect pretty variable pays throughout the year.What you get from me:- Interesting (not all the time) projects that you don’t need to look for yourself.- Someone available and comprehensive to work with. I have experience in this field and I know the struggles that can come with it. I will be there to discuss and assist in any way I can.- Most of the pay you will generate: I would obviously take a cut off of projects you would undertake as a remuneration for running the logistics of the business, but I aim to make it as fair as possible to you.- Possibility to grow: once again you won’t make millions to begin with, but as our revenues increase, I hope to reward you as best as I can. Also, if our partnership is fruitful, there is a possibility for you to obtain a better position as one of the first members. Maybe managing a team yourself or something like this, we’ll see in due time.Little pluses:- Language proficiency: I personally speak English, French and Spanish. You obviously must be fluent in English, but it’d be great if you master other languages so we can comfortably approach other clients.- You live in Europe or SEA: I’m from Europe and will be living part time in SEA in the foreseeable future. It would be great to have the possibility to meet if we plan on working together long term.- You have other skills: I mainly need video editors as this is the most profitable niche, but I also undertake projects including Voice Over, Graphic Design and Web Design. It will be very handy if you can do any of these as well.Also remember that the criteria above are more of a wishlist rather than mandatory criteria; feel free to reach out even if you don’t tick all the boxes :)Please send me your resume/portfolio/links to your best work, and start your application with “YOU NEED ME BECAUSE..” + the reason why you want to onboard the project, so I know you read my (way too) long offer. I am not only looking for employees but rather long term partners, and I hope you share my vision.I’m looking forward to hearing from you,Max.Hourly Range: $5.00-$15.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 20:30 UTCCategory: Video EditingSkills:Video Editing, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, English, Motion GraphicsSkills: Video Editing, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, English, Motion GraphicsCountry: Belgium\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered max, and, recently-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Recently I've been shooting a experimental music video for a song that I wrote- which is largley regarding a live dance performance. The problem is that the shots that I emotionally connect with the most have some visual technical issues. Instead of reshooting the footage I was wondering if I could get some VFX to use the shots that I have as of now.1. A dance scene where the dancer is supposed to run through some curtains but ends up mistakenly running elsewhere and I want to erase her from the shot entirely (about maybe 2~3seconds)2. A close up shot of a old man at night face and walls show a shadow if the camera rig shadows due to lighting issues.3. Smoothening some transitions that make it seem more of a smooth a \"long take\" such as the camera cutting while going through curtains. I was wondering if we could add some extra added vfx flair to make these transitions a bit more natural.Posted On: February 22, 2024 08:52 UTCCategory: Visual EffectsSkills:Chroma Keying, Compositing, Keying, Match Moving, Video Cleanup, Video Post-Editing, VideographySkills: Chroma Keying, Compositing, Keying, Match Moving, Video Cleanup, Video Post-Editing, VideographyCountry: South Korea\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered indie, filmamker, korea-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Your second task will be to create some new scripts for me. Bonus points if you are able to send me screenshots of dashboards, you have created in monday.com.Most of the scripts are fairly simple, like pulling down items from a board and updating items on another board. Some scripts are more complicated, connecting to other third-party APIs.Here is a basic case:1. I have an email automation that is already running. This is a native automation that simply adds a new email as a new item on the board and adds the body of the email as an update.2. Have the script parse through the update data of the email item to extract the email address for where the email came from.3. Then do a look up on the email column from another contacts board to get an item ID from a match of the email address column in the first board4. Update the connected column in the email board with the ID of the contact item from the second board.You’ll be required to estimate this as part of your proposal. I am a developer and have already created the structure for this exact script and have an idea for how long it should take.

I need a graphic designer who can be my go-to for creating cool course covers and other bits and pieces.Right now, I've got about 20 covers on my list, and there might be more work down the line. To kick things off, I'm bringing in a few designers to create three covers each. Based on those, I'll pick my top candidate for the ongoing work.I’m after covers that look great, keep to a consistent style, and share some design elements to tie them all together. They should stand out on their own, yet come together to scream one cohesive brand.**Objective:**The goal of this project is to create three images that capture the essence of playing guitar, with the guitar player image as a focal point, presented in a distinctive monochrome with spot color style as shown in the provided sample images.**Key Elements:**1. **Color Scheme:** Use a monochrome base, blue, with a single contrasting spot color, orange (#ff9933), to highlight specific aspects of the image.2. **Texture:** Incorporate a grainy, textured overlay that gives the images a slightly weathered and tactile feel, reminiscent of classic vinyl cover art.3. **Subject Matter:** Focus on close-up shots of musicians' hands interacting with their instruments, such as fingers on guitar strings.4. **Composition:** Ensure the composition is dynamic and tightly cropped, creating an intimate and immediate connection with the subject.5. **Lighting and Shadows:** Use dramatic lighting to emphasize the texture and to create deep shadows, enhancing the three-dimensional feel of the hands and instruments.6. **Artistic Style:** Mimic the artistic style that combines elements of pop art with a vintage poster look, maintaining a balance between modern and retro aesthetics.**Deliverables:**1. Three images Size: 650 px x 300 px., each focusing on a different guitar player image.2. Images should be JPEG optimized for the web.3. Source files in editable formats (PSD).**Inspiration:**Refer to the provided sample images, which give a range of possibilities and ideas: [REDACTED_URL] They all feature the guitar player with a strong contrast between the blue and orange hues and a pronounced grainy texture.**Usage:**These images will be used for a guitar instruction website as course covers (thumbnails).**Provided Images:**Dropbox link: [REDACTED_URL] may need to remove the background.**Want to apply?**If you would like to be considered for this project, please provide samples of your work, let me know how much you would charge and a time frame to complete it.Thanks for your time.Hourly Range: $15.00-$35.00Posted On: February 23, 2024 02:49 UTCCategory: Graphic DesignSkills:Website Asset, Graphic Design, Adobe PhotoshopSkills: Website Asset, Graphic Design, Adobe PhotoshopCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hey, there, run-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
