The concept artwork is required to support the product design.The product:A set of glasses worn by an adult.The glasses will allow the wearer to see thermal imagery projected within the lenses using transparent OLED and prismatic lens glass. So the glasses will read their environment using cameras: one corner will have a thermal camera lens and the other corner will have a normal camera lens. The settings should have a symmetrical look, set within the top corners of the frame in an outward facing position.The arms of the glasses frames with be widened to accommodate thermal image camera circuitry and power pack, plus mucro usb charging socket.Initially we are looking for a virtual 3D model to be create, so that the model can be 3D printed whilst also being easily edited/adjusted to suit the component sizes that are sourced for prototyping. With this in mind... The concept art should be created in a CAD software such as one of the Auto desk suite of applications or similar like Blender. There will be a need for various file formats to be exported: DWG, VRML, DXF, OBJModelling the glasses as a 3d model will allow for adjustments to be made when more is known about component sizes based on the final chosen procurement deals.If you're interested in this project it might be worth knowing there will be others to create for in the future.I will update this brief with some sketches to support the project requirements soon.Budget: $80Posted On: February 16, 2024 23:02 UTCCategory: 3D AnimationSkills:3D Modeling, Autodesk Maya, 3D Rendering, Blender, Product DesignSkills: 3D Modeling, Autodesk Maya, 3D Rendering, Blender, Product DesignCountry: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered what, our, company-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Some unique features Let's has is a system of suggestions and voting and a map view. The app is launched and has some success stories. It is still in early stages and we are still looking for traction.Some tasks/projects in our backlog* We recently switched design programs to Figma. So the first task is to create the app as it is today in Figma -- that includes ~15 screens for each mobile and web.* Make the \"share link\" button more prominent* Calendar view: week view, day view. This is unique because we must handle multiple suggestions, show votes, and show your own availability.* Adding availability time ranges. This is like saying \"I'm available from 2 PM to 4 PM\".* Graphic design of the time suggestion title* Availability table of business hours and time suggestions.

Since the odds are 2.00, for every unit bet (£34.97 in this case), the winner would receive £34.97 * 2 = £69.94.The chance of winning is the potential payout divided by the total amount collected:Chance of winning = Potential payout / Total amount collected= (£34.97 * 2) / (£34.97 * 1999)= 2 / 1999≈ 0.0010005To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:Chance of winning ≈ 0.[REDACTED_NUM] * 100≈ 0.10005%So, with the given odds, ticket price, and number of tickets sold, the chance of winning is approximately 0.10005%.Budget: $200Posted On: February 22, 2024 09:16 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:WordPressSkills: WordPressCountry: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered looking, for, soemone-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

How do spiritual innovators in the 21st century interpret and iterate on ancient wisdom to meet contemporary and future challenges? How can such evolving wisdom be made accessible to all who seek it in an increasingly global, religiously pluralistic, digital world?Following more than a year of research, Sacred Design Lab is producing a public-facing report on spiritual innovation worldwide. The project is funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation, which supports innovations that contribute to human flourishing. You can learn more about the project at this link. The audience for the report is spiritual innovators, religious leaders and institutions, funders, investors, and other potential partners looking to support spiritual innovation.Sacred Design Lab’s founding members were trained at Harvard Divinity School and have spent a decade working to map and understand the spiritual landscape in the United States, with a particular focus on supporting innovators. This is the first time we have expanded our research globally and we are eager to include artwork that reflects the spiritual lives of people around the world.Request for ProposalsWe are seeking illustrations for a public-facing report on global spiritual innovation, which will most likely take the form of a PDF document housed on Sacred Design Lab’s website. We define spiritual innovation as “A novel way to address spiritual longings that leads to flourishing people and planet.”We plan to commission six illustrations from artists in six different parts of the world on this theme. The design guidelines for your illustration are as follows:For the content of your illustration, respond to the question: What does spiritual innovation mean to you?Consider: Relationship between past and future, ancient wisdom and emergent technologies, religious traditions and lineage, creativity and possibility, soul needs of the present and futureIllustrations should be detailed, multi-faceted, and represent the individual illustrator’s style and point of view, while taking into consideration any art direction provided in terms of color, style, and sizing.We encourage you to draw on themes based on your personal experience and your own cultural and / or religious context.Approach/StyleHere are two previous reports by Sacred Design Lab for an idea of past approaches to the work: project 1, project 2. Some descriptive words for this project: Welcoming, soulful, spacious, expert but non-academic, some iconography, non-corporate, pathos not cutesy.Candidate QualificationsExperience creating professional quality illustrations.Must live in or have deep familiarity with a culture within one of the following regionsAsiaLatin AmericaAfricaEuropeMiddle EastOceaniaStrong communication, organizational, and time-management skills.Kind, collaborative, able to work independently.Proposal RequirementsIn an email or document please provide:Examples of your illustration work, ideally in context of a report or other written materialsResumeParagraph and sketch describing your proposed illustrationTimelineWe will select illustrators, one from each of six regions, for this project by February 19, 2024. Upon selection, each illustrator will be provided with art direction and any additional context. Illustrators are to submit their piece by March 1, 2024. Any feedback will be delivered to the illustrators within 5 business days. Final illustration and file hand-off will be due by mid-March, 2024.Budget and logisticsBudget for the project is a flat rate of $350 per illustration.To process your honorarium if outside the US, we will request a W8-BEN form, outgoing wire form, and bank authorization (if inside the US, W-9 form and ACH info)Selected illustrators will have their name, one-line bio, and website/social link included in the final report alongside their illustration.Budget: $350Posted On: February 15, 2024 21:34 UTCCategory: IllustrationSkills:IllustrationSkills: IllustrationCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered project, backgroundwhat, spiritual-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
