We also want to make sure that the UX/UI of the Zoho interface created, that sales agents and management will interact with, is a light weight, simple, and intuitive as possible.ObjectiveTo design a workflow that enhances lead management, deal progression, agreement signatures, document collection, and deal funding.Requirements1. Lead Import• Use Zoho CRM's data import tools to migrate csv files, ensuring proper column mapping during the import process.2. Lead Distribution• Implement Zoho CRM's Assignment Rules to distribute leads to sales reps. (Different Lead Buckets)3. Sales Pipeline• Set up Sales Stages and Pipelines in Zoho CRM to accurately track the progress of leads through the sales process.4. Data Entry Customization• Customize the layout of the main CRM page to mirror old CRM solution (extremely simple), creating any necessary custom fields for data entry.5. Application Generation Workflow• Utilize Zoho CRM workflows to automate the generation of basic pdf applications based on specific data entry.6. eDocument and Signatures• Integrate with Zoho Sign for digital signatures, automating the sending of documents to customers.7. Bank Statement Collection• Configure Zoho CRM to capture and store email-led bank statements, integration with Zoho Work Drive or another solution that can be incorporated into Zoho CRM.8. Underwriter Review Process• Setup a process within Zoho CRM to package signed documents and bank statements, initiating the file transfer to the underwriter.9. Workflow Automation and Functional Buttons• Implement additional Zoho CRM workflows for automation needs and configure functional buttons on the main CRM page to trigger specific actions.10. Misc. Requirements• Bank Section to send files manually by admin or underwriter• When csv files get imported into Zoho they need to be in General Lead Folder. Those leads are available to all sales reps.

I note that Model Articles for your company have been filed which means that Article 10(2) is the relevant provision. This Article advises that a quorum for a directors meeting can be fixed from time to time but sets the default quorum as 2 directors. Previously it was considered that article 7(2) of the Model Articles permitted decision making by 1 director where there is only 1 director of the company. This has now been interpreted to mean that a company must have at least 2 directors to make valid decisions (such as agreeing to enter into a mortgage) where this provision has not been varied in the model articles.As you are the sole director of your company, without amendment it means that any board meetings and minutes that you complete, do not currently comply with the articles of the company.In order to proceed, we need for you to arrange for your company’s articles of association to be varied by way of a written resolution, and the resolution to be filed at Companies House, so as to disapply the quorum requirement under article 10(2). I will need you to send evidence of this to me as soon as possible to ensure you comply with your mortgage terms and conditions, which require you to provide valid board meeting minutes.Budget: $120Posted On: February 23, 2024 10:40 UTCCategory: Business & Corporate LawSkills:Legal, Legal Writing, Corporate Law, Real Estate, Finance & AccountingSkills: Legal, Legal Writing, Corporate Law, Real Estate, Finance & AccountingCountry: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered buying, buy, let-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

The subscription segment is done by Sumo Subscription, having ACF fields and custom code within the product pages. The website operates with two currencies: EUR and RON/LEI. Presently, the following issues persist on the site:P*yment Failure: Users encounter an error message stating, \"Sorry, it seems that there are no available p*yment methods. Please contact us if you require assistance or wish to make alternate arrangements,\" when attempting card payments.Currency Conversion Glitch: Conversion from EUR to RON is occurring inaccurately. For instance, instead of the correct calculation (e.g., 66 euros * 4.98 = 328.68 lei), it's erroneously multiplying the conversion rate twice (e.g., 66 euros * 4.98 * 4.98 = 1600 lei). This issue appears to be linked to the Sumo Subscription plugin as disabling this feature rectifies the problem in the cart.Subscription Confirmation Uncertainty: There's uncertainty regarding the functionality of the subscription service. Following successful payments in the past, receipt of an e*il indicating \"subscription cancelled\" raises concerns about the subscription system's reliability.These issues significantly impact the user experience and the platform's functionality. Addressing and resolving these concerns promptly is essential to ensure smooth operation and customer satisfaction.Budget: $150Posted On: February 20, 2024 19:28 UTCCategory: Ecommerce Website DevelopmentSkills:WooCommerce, PHP, WordPress, Ecommerce Website Development, WordPress Plugin, Web DevelopmentSkills: WooCommerce, PHP, WordPress, Ecommerce Website Development, WordPress Plugin, Web Development\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered currently, manage, commerce-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Unlike traditional furniture shopping, we delve into the essence of personalization and customization. Our service allows customers to submit their room layouts, which we then use to match them with top interior designers. These designers create bespoke designs tailored to each customer's individual preferences, transforming their space into a personalized haven. Our mission is to materialize our customers' visions into reality, making their dream home a tangible experience.Objective:The logo should embody the spirit of bespoke interior design and personalization, reflecting our innovative approach to transforming spaces.

They value quality, uniqueness, and the ability to tailor their environment to reflect their personal taste.Creative Freedom:We encourage creativity and innovation in the design process. The logo should be more than a graphic; it should tell a story and evoke a feeling of home, personalization, and the transformation journey we offer our clients. While we've outlined the essence of our brand, we invite you to bring your own vision and ideas to the forefront. Feel free to explore different concepts, styles, and elements that you believe will best represent \"Home It.\"Design Considerations:The logo should be versatile, easily adaptable across various media including web, print, and merchandise.It should remain effective both in color and in black and white.While we're open to any creative direction, the final design should be clear and recognizable at different sizes.Deliverables:Few Concepts to be delivered to pick from them.Pick concept and then have iteration for reviews till final versionVariations for different applications (e.g., website, business cards, social media).A brief explanation of the concept behind the chosen design and any specific symbolism used along with brand identity document.Timeline and Communication:Please provide initial concepts within 3-4 days for first draft and then entire project to be finalized in 2 weeks, with room for feedback and revisions. Open communication is key to us; we're eager to see your preliminary ideas and develop them further together.This brief aims to provide a clear understanding of our brand and the message we want to convey without limiting your creative process.

These structural features increase the surface area of the fibers, enhancing their ability to absorb and evaporate moisture efficiently. In the realm of thermal regulation, this translates to better breathability. When the body sweats, the moisture is absorbed by the bamboo fabric and then evaporated, which has a cooling effect. Conversely, in cooler environments, these structural features help in trapping air, which is a good insulator, thereby retaining heat.Budget: $10Posted On: February 20, 2024 17:05 UTCCategory: IllustrationSkills:Illustration, Graphic Design, Adobe Illustrator, InfographicSkills: Illustration, Graphic Design, Adobe Illustrator, InfographicCountry: Lebanon\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered need, someone, draw-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
