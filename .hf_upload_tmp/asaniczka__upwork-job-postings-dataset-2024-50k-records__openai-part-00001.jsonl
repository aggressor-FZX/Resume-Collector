For example, I should be able to enable or disable the RSI, OBV, and EMA conditions individually based on my preference. This flexibility will allow me to customize the indicator according to different market conditions and trading strategies.Adjustable Parameters:• It’s essential that the parameters for each condition are adjustable within the indicator’s settings. For instance, I should be able to specify the RSI range for oversold and overbought conditions (e.g., RSI ranging from 30 to 40 for oversold), as well as adjust other parameters such as the length of the EMA period or the sensitivity of the divergence detection.Examples of Adjustable RSI Ranges:• In particular, for the RSI condition, it would be beneficial to specify ranges such as 30-40 for oversold and 60-70 for overbought, allowing for more precise customization of trading signals based on RSI levels.Posted On: February 14, 2024 04:01 UTCCategory: Scripting & AutomationSkills:Pine Script, PythonSkills: Pine Script, PythonCountry: Australia\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered python, automation-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.

I teach music classes to little kids and have an up and running website that I made using squarespace and jotform. My website is www.saddleriversong.com. I need the following:1) I need class lists generated automatically, by class. I currently use the submissions tab in jotform, but I don't find it easy to use since it mixes classes. I'd like to move class lists to a third party platform.2) I need to cap the number of kids in each class by location. Some locations are capped to 12 kids, some are capped at 18 kids.3) I need a waitlist button added wherein parents do not need to pay at the bottom of the page. Right now, the payment part is required, and I can't figure out a way to override this if a class is waitlisted.4) I need to integrate an option for families to purchase a discounted classpack of 8 via a stripe link (already created), wherein they are able to select classes and apply their classpack on the jotform page.5) I am open to using a different platform if this isn't doable on jotform, but I'd really prefer to stick with it if possible.6) I need a way to email the parents in each class (not by location, by specific class at that location) quickly and easily.I need this all done this week.Thank you!CarlyHourly Range: $15.00-$30.00Posted On: February 20, 2024 03:24 UTCCategory: Web DesignSkills:Jotform, Web Design, Web DevelopmentSkills: Jotform, Web Design, Web DevelopmentCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered teach, music, classes-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

High level of service and just as affordable as the other options.Things to be aware of when looking for a c-gCertification and experience – some providers have neitherBackground checks – the c-g have access to your home so must be trustyReliability – no shows and late arrivals are common, agencies give you a point of contact when this happensYou may want to cover the variety of care available. 24/7 care for a bedridden person is different than 3-4 hours a couple of times a week just to provide some extra help.Key Termshow to find a c-ghow to get home health care for parentshow to find a c-g for elderlyhow to hire a c-ghow to find a live in c-gIf you find this article is a little short then you can add a section based on this key word “caregiver interview questions”.

We have the CAD for all the shells (that go around the outside of the device) but not yet for the material folding covers.We've got about 5 new product styles, each have approximately 10 images each that we need creating to show the back/front/inside/standing positions, etc.Each of those 10 sets of images will ultimately be needed in approximately 5-10 colours. (We will have 5-10 colour variations per product type).This is the 1st time we'll be attempting rendered images, and the reason we haven't in the past is that the materials haven't looked real enough. We want them to look like photographs, essentially. With the same photography style we use today on our images.It's super important the materials and textures are right, and the lighting.I think Adobe Substance 3D for this is the right tool, so we can use actual photos of the lining materials to ensure that the materials look 100%.There are 4 parts to each image:1) the shell/bumper which we have in CAD already2) the internal lining3) the external PU4) the iPad itself (currently, without screen as we won't know the screen image until Apple launches it).First job will be just a trial to create the renders of the covers for the iPad (see example attached) with the iPad inside, so we can try and replicate 1 or 2 existing images to check the amount of work required for the rest of the project (for both sides!)We need someone who's super skilled in Adobe Substance and able to send over the asset sets after the 1st test. Once happy, we can agree timeline and cost for the rest of the job. Needs to be finished total by end of March.Please send thru any questions and/or similar products you've done before and also availability as it's quite a big project and we need 100% assurance that it'll be done on time as we've had Upworkers go AWOL in the past.Looking to start 1st stage of the project ASAP this week to test viability.ThanksPosted On: February 19, 2024 13:55 UTCCategory: 3D Modeling & RenderingSkills:3D Rendering, Adobe Substance 3D, Graphic DesignSkills: 3D Rendering, Adobe Substance 3D, Graphic DesignCountry: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered are, premium, brand-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Due to the sensitive nature of the systems involved, testing must be done in an isolated lab environment that replicates the production server configuration.The initial vulnerability assessment found the server permits connections using SSL 2.0 and 3.0, protocols that are no longer considered secure. To strengthen protections, these will need to be disabled on the server configuration. Additionally, the assessment recommends migrating to TLS 1.2 as the minimum encryption standard, using cipher suites that provide adequate security.The contractor's role will be to test the environment to mirror the production Linux server. Thorough testing is then required to validate all critical business services and applications continue running as expected with the proposed SSL/TLS changes implemented. Once verified, recommendations for applying the same upgrades to the live production server in a planned migration can be provided.The overall goal is to bolster security by eliminating use of outdated and vulnerable protocols while ensuring minimum disruption to operations. Configuring the isolated lab system and thoroughly verifying compatibility and operations across applications is key before any changes go live.Hourly Range: $10.00-$15.00Posted On: February 19, 2024 13:55 UTCCategory: Information SecuritySkills:Vulnerability Assessment, SSL, Linux, Internet Protocol SecuritySkills: Vulnerability Assessment, SSL, Linux, Internet Protocol SecurityCountry: Pakistan\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered this, project, aims-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Specifically, I am looking for designs that are simple yet impactful, capable of standing out in a crowded market while still embodying the essence of our brand.For your reference, our competitors include prominent brands such as ZARA, RHUDE, OFF-WHITE, and FEAR OF GOD. Our goal is to create logos that not only match the quality and aesthetic appeal of these brands but also contribute to our unique identity in the streetwear scene.To achieve this, I envision the creation of three distinct logos:Primary Logo: This will serve as the main representation of our brand and should be instantly recognizable and memorable.Secondary Logo: While complementing our primary logo, this design should offer versatility and be suitable for various applications and contexts.Submark Logo: A simplified version of our primary logo, designed to be used in smaller spaces or as a subtle brand identifier. Typically for social media profile pictures.I believe that your creative insights and expertise in logo design will be invaluable in bringing our vision to life.
