This has originally been written in word format and is not particularly engaging.What am I looking for?1. A complete refresh of the design. The content can remain the same for now, but I want something that is slick, clean and modern, ideally with some infographics to make the document engaging to my customers2. I would want an editable version as each guide is customized for the client so I would need opportunity to be able to populate some of the sections.3. I don't really have a company name or brand currently, so it's just the colours, imagery and look that I wish to create for now. I am very keen on something modern, slick and minimalist. I don't want corporate.Examples of styles I like are attached as well as the actual document itself. The visual is really important to me to ensure a premium feel is given.The only request I have is to have the first page as a single page allowing for the client's name to be inputted as a little gift from myselfI want thoughtfulness, creativity and initiative on document that is currently very dull indeed.I don't have a fixed price, but am willing to pay more for someone who can really showcase me something they have done similarly and can do this gig with minimum supervison.Many thanks!!WillPosted On: February 20, 2024 14:27 UTCCategory: Graphic DesignSkills:Infographic, Publication Design, Presentation Design, Information Design, Graphic Design, Layout Design, Adobe InDesignSkills: Infographic, Publication Design, Presentation Design, Information Design, Graphic Design, Layout Design, Adobe InDesignCountry: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered upworkersi, urgent, need-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

This project focuses on the fashion industry.The deliverable of our project is a dynamic online platform, functioning as a virtual library curated to aggregate comprehensive knowledge regarding the intersection of fashion and sustainability. This website serves a dual purpose: to debunk myth and misconceptions about the fashion industry, while empowering individuals with actionable insights.This website is mostly informational and will be comprised of articles and blog posts for the most part, divided into 3 main categories:1. Present and make the multifaceted impacts of the fashion industry understandable and clear. We will deal with the implications of the entire supply chain, focusing on the connections between consumption patterns and the environmental and societal consequences of fashion production and distribution.2. The second main section is about helping people navigate this complicated landscape and invite them to engage with sustainable fashion.3. Finally, as we try to bring about a new vision for fashion, anchored in sustainability and principles like sufficiency and wellbeing, there will be an entire section dedicated to showcasing already existing alternatives and address the important things to consider for stakeholders in the sector that would like to incorporate such considerations in their business. We will offer prompts that envision what the fashion industry could look like in a world guided by sustainability.In essence, the deliverable—a comprehensive and user-friendly website—will serve as an invaluable bank of knowledge, equipped with practical tools, and inspirational examples, all aimed at transforming the way individuals perceive, engage with, and contribute to fashion.1.

Not so much sustainable fashion.Study the landscape and the target audience to know about their user profile and contribute to how we articulate the information displayed on the website (proposition in term of content as well).• Industry overview:Analyse the industry’s current trends and emphasis, styles… To identify how we can be most effective and relevant to the public.• Website layout and design.• Design website and prototyping for the webdevelopper.2. Graphic designLogoThis website will need a strong graphic identity that reflects the following characteristics:• Modern but simple: aligning with the sector’s general aesthetic.• Focus on sustainability and supporting the imagining of a fashion that contributes to well-being and has environmental and social benefits.• The link and capacity to blend within VOICE’s ecosystem.Considering the age bracket of our audience, this will be a mobile first platform.We will need a number of templates for social media that could be displayed on VOICE’s platform. The project will not have its own SM accounts.• Instagram posts (different types)• Guides• Event calendar and eventsIdeal time frame:We aim to dedicate a month, working at a full-time capacity, around the months of April and May to complete this task.As we are a non-profit, our budget is quite tight.Please contact us with a quote.Hourly Range: $15.00-$25.00Posted On: February 13, 2024 12:38 UTCCategory: Web DesignSkills:Figma, Prototyping, UI/UX Prototyping, Web Design, Graphic Design, Logo Design, Website AssetSkills: Figma, Prototyping, UI/UX Prototyping, Web Design, Graphic Design, Logo Design, Website AssetCountry: Ireland\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered threads, change, months-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

It does this by looking at the HTML on the group members page and extract the information from there.Our current method of extracting members has a limitation that as the list of members grows it takes longer for more members to get scrolled onto the page. At 3000 members it takes 5 second to scroll another 10 on the pagebut when you get to 6000 members it takes 10 seconds to scroll another 10 on the page, and it gets slower from there so a group with 50K members would take days to import.We have competitors that extract the group members by making an HTTP request to [REDACTED_URL] instead of scraping the data from the page. This seems to work well even when there are a large number of group members. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTED API and I suspect it is for Facebook internal use only!!For this job you will write a replacement for our member import code that instead gets the group members using the undocumented Facebook API.

The inventory table would have 'productid', 'quantity', 'unixtimestamp', and a calculated datetime column.Your objective is to identify the top 20 performing products and offer insightful answers to the following questions:1. Unpacking Excellence: Explore why these top 20 products consistently outperform the competition. Delve into the underlying factors driving their success, and don't hesitate to think creatively.2. The Impact of Strategies and Events: Investigate whether there are any specific strategies or events that have played a significant role in influencing the sales performance of these products.
