My daughter, Grace, is 9 years old and transitioning early into a \"tween\" and wants to redo the whole thing. We are looking for someone who can help us with both the ideation process -- give Grace some visual options for her to \"decide\" -- and then help us turn the concept into a reality by finding the furniture & accents to purchase within a budget. We live in Orange County, CA.My wife and I have come across a few local providers that offer different options on how to work with them -- ranging from full packaged outsourced design services to ones that provide more of a handholding DIY service providing assistance. Most of these businesses are agencies and are way over our budget and we don't like that they work exclusively on a commission basis with a short list of wholesalers / retailers.I think biggest thing we are seeking beyond the general design concepts is someone with extensive knowledge and access to the market of sellers (including any custom makers).What exactly do we want?I am including a couple pictures of what it looks like now. You will notice the room is small (approximately 10'8\" in length x 10'3\") -- I am attaching 2 pictures from two different corners of the room, and then two drawings that provide the dimensions of the walls, along with measurements of the window, door frames, etc...Grace says she wants the wallpaper removed / replaced. Wants to do away with the pink overall -- replace the rug (she sent me these two links recently on ones she likes on amazon: [REDACTED_URL] & [REDACTED_URL] She wants to get rid of the bed frame (too bulky) and replace it with something lower and that occupies less space and maybe has drawers on the bottom? -- we will keep the mattress. We want a dresser that fits inside the closet. And then conceptually for decor we are looking for accents that can use the wall creatively. Grace is really into makeup and is considering a vanity desk (she already has a mirror).Anyway, the above is just a intro. Can provide further guidance.It would be great to find someone to help with both the creative process and who can help us be smart about purchase decisions accounting for a reasonable budget. We care about quality but price matters too -- so we are somewhere in the middle between value shoppers and investing in things that will last.Not exactly sure how to structure the job engagement / scope etc...so will leave it up to proposed ideas, bids and go from there.Looking forward to working with you.Posted On: February 20, 2024 21:50 UTCCategory: Interior DesignSkills:Concept Design, 3D Modeling, Residential Design, Interior Design, SketchUp, Furniture, ProposalSkills: Concept Design, 3D Modeling, Residential Design, Interior Design, SketchUp, Furniture, ProposalLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered looking, for, independent-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I need someone who can mail out mailchimps, keep records how they are doing, and explain it to me in layman's language. We have Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok accounts, but no one is going to those sites yet. I need someone to monitor the social media accounts and make them popular. We have a Store selling products on Shopify but we are not selling anything yet. We have a three-minute song from the show, I Feel Strong! that I would like to see go viral on YouTube. We have a Discussion Guide for elementary school teachers, available through Prevent Child Abuse Vermont. On the top of the website that will be sent to schools and theaters in the United States and Canada, there are many links that explain everything about the show. I am sending my website and announcements to elementary schools and children's theaters in the U.S. and Canada. BNM can be performed BY kids as a full show, or scene by scene over time, and presented at weekly meetings, or by children's theaters. It can also be performed FOR children by older students and adults. The person who set it up was wonderful and worked with me for over a year. He sent them free at first, but went up to 75,000, and ran out of funds. The account is on pause. I need to reactivate it with a middle-priced account. Can I keep the 75,000 for the future in the Mailchimp archive, but only pay and use a smaller number? We are starting a fund-raising campaign to pay for mailchimps, grants to schools in Title 1 communities, and social media exposure. Bully No More! is sponsored by the non-profit Bully No More Foundation Ltd. This can be a part-time, ongoing job as I want to continue sending out mailchimps. It is very important that we Zoom, at least once a week, to avoid continuous emails. A lot is accomplished with back-and-forth live communication. I am looking for an individual who knows mailchimp, social media, and, who is experienced, clever, and knowledgeable and has been successful with a good track record.

Our system is designed to provide a seamless and secure user experience by facilitating user identification and interaction through advanced machine vision technologies.Background: Our venues operate with a unique user registration and identification process. Upon registration, users provide a photograph of themselves along with their driver’s license for KYC validation. This process involves liveliness detection and a match verification between the user’s photograph and their driver’s license image, facilitated by a KYC partner. The user's facial vector representation is then stored in the cloud for subsequent identification at our venues.Current System Overview:User Identification: When a user logs in at a venue, their vector representation is transferred to the local venue's system, which supports up to 100 users concurrently. We utilize infrared (IR) cameras to overcome the challenges posed by bright overhead lighting, which cannot be modified. Our setup includes two cameras per play area, using body location data from both cameras for user positioning and facial matching.Facial Matching: We employ a two-tiered tolerance approach for facial matching:High Tolerance Matching: Used upon entry into the play area under better lighting conditions for initial identification.Low Tolerance (Stricter) Matching: Applied in smaller, more interactive sections of the play area for precise matching.Body Kinetic Analysis: The system is also tasked with collecting body kinetic data during gameplay, focusing on metrics such as shoulder and hip turn, arm position, etc., primarily for golf swing analysis.Challenges and Objectives:Enhance Body Detection and Facial Matching: Improve the accuracy and reliability of human body detection and facial matching, overcoming issues related to poor performance and inaccurate matching.Develop Golf Swing Metric Analysis: Refine and expand the system's capability to analyze body kinetic information, specifically targeting golf swing metrics.Cost and Performance Optimization: Achieve a balance between reducing hardware and software licensing costs and enhancing overall system performance, with a priority on the latter.System Requirements:Experience with IR imaging and overcoming lighting challenges in machine vision applications.Expertise in facial recognition technologies, including liveliness detection and vector representation matching.Proficiency in body kinetic analysis, with a focus on sports metrics (e.g., golf swing analysis).Ability to work with existing systems and potentially integrate or license third-party solutions to meet project objectives.Support and Collaboration: We are committed to providing necessary resources, including sample images and videos, to facilitate the development process. We encourage open communication and inquiry to ensure a comprehensive understanding of our system and objectives.Hourly Range: $30.00-$110.00Posted On: February 17, 2024 22:59 UTCCategory: Machine LearningSkills:Computer VisionSkills: Computer VisionCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered project, description, enhancement-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

We are a beacon for those who dare to disrupt the fashion industry with audacity and creativity. Our brand is a celebration of the rebels, the thinkers, and the dreamers who see fashion as more than clothing—it's a form of expression, a stand against conformity, and a dialogue with society.Our Essence:We thrive on the edge of innovation and rebellion, where bold expressions and unconventional creativity collide to challenge fashion norms. \"Enfant Terrible\" is about making statements that resonate, provoke thought, and spark conversation. Our designs are not just worn; they're experienced.Objective:We're searching for a logo that is as impactful and rebellious as our brand. This includes a captivating mascot logo—a 20-year-old boxer with a story told through scars and a demeanor that speaks volumes—and a striking wordmark that captures our avant-garde ethos.Mascot Logo Detailed Vision:The mascot should be a symbol of defiance and resilience, depicted through expressive line art that captures the spirit of a young boxer ready to challenge the world. His scar under one eye and buzzcut should reflect a narrative of survival and fighting spirit. This mascot isn’t just for \"Enfant Terrible\"; it's for our community that stands against creative conformity.Wordmark:The wordmark should embody the essence of our brand—bold, artistic, and unapologetically avant-garde. It needs to complement the mascot yet be strong enough to stand on its own across our fashion lines and branding materials.Creative Liberty:In addition to the boxer concept, we invite you to propose a second mascot concept. This is your canvas to interpret \"Enfant Terrible\" in a way you see fit. Impress us with your creativity.Design Preferences:Style: The mascot should be realized in a cartoon style with not to much detail but still capturing emotion and narrative. The wordmark should be distinct and memorable, embodying the brand's avant-garde personality.Color Palette: We entrust you with the color palette. Draw from the brand's essence of rebellion and avant-garde artistry. We're looking for something that makes a statement but remains versatile across various applications.Application:This logo will be our standard-bearer, appearing everywhere from digital domains like our website and social media to the tangible world of our clothing and promotional materials. It must be versatile, scalable, and iconic.Budget and Timeline:Budget: Allocated 200 to 400 euros. We view this as an investment in a partnership to bring the essence of \"Enfant Terrible\" to visual life.Timeline: Your expertise is valuable to us. Provide an estimated timeline based on the project's scope, ensuring quality and creativity are not compromised.Deliverables:Complete vector and raster files for both mascot and wordmark logos.A mini brand guide outlining the usage of logos, including the chosen color palette and any typography specifications.Selection Criteria:Demonstrated ability to craft narratives through design, with a portfolio that showcases expertise in line art and branding.Insightful interpretation of brand ethos into compelling visual stories.Effective communicator, ready for a collaborative creative process.Proposal Request:Kindly send your proposal, inclusive of your portfolio, estimated timeline, and quote.Posted On: February 19, 2024 13:27 UTCCategory: Logo DesignSkills:Logo Design, Graphic Design, Adobe Illustrator, Brand Identity & GuidelinesSkills: Logo Design, Graphic Design, Adobe Illustrator, Brand Identity & GuidelinesCountry: Netherlands\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered enhanced, logo, design-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Set your price what you thing the job is worth.Now the job:Hello, I have a web server that keeps getting infected by warms... its on Apache with php,mysql on Debian. No matter what I do viruses keep infecting neighboring sites (vhosts) and things at this point are beyond repair. So I've been advised to go the docker way with a reverse proxy with WAF in front the website containers and it sounds promising.Important:I do not want the job just done once but to know how to set it up myself in case everything goes south...If I have to summarize - I need a step by step tutorial how to turn brand new Ubuntu server into this (as follows):1 Docker container - proxy (nginx) + waf like in this tutorial ([REDACTED_URL] + Certbot or other auto ssl solution with cronjob.3 more containers as follows1 wordpress (latest)1 joomla (latest)1 drupal (latest)- Static IP's on the containers- Php on each container to be at least 8.0- Bash on every container- SSH with unique port on the host machine forwarding to each container,- Phpmyadmin on every container,- Files from each container's www directory have to be mapped to a host machine folder in order to be preserved in the case of rebuilding the container. - here I have a little dejavu with the cross-contamination of my current setup, so if not a good idea to pup files from different sites close to eachother, then we can skip this setup and I'll think of a regular file backup- This would be nice as well: [REDACTED_URL] you have any suggestions to better the idea explained in the beginning - please do so.I may have asked stupid stuff above as I am new to how Docker works and what can or can not be done... so please feel free to correct me so the job requirement becomes more clear.

This only shop we already connected to our ERP-system, which we are using for processing the orders. The ERP we are using is JTL Wawi, a German software solution and the the core management tool for this and other JTL webshops.We have experience with our JTL Shop and Wawi System however we struggle right now with properly implementing final and crucial aspects of the Woocommerce shop so that processing of orders, payment solutions, EU shopping conformities like OSS aspects so as displaying correct gross-pricing etc.Since interface-connection between JTL Wawi and Woocommerce is not as streamlined as between JTL Shop and JTL Wawi we are insecure about going next steps. We cannot estimate at this point which things still need to be done to avoid teething problems with the release of the webshop.This is why we need a developer especially for the correct setting up connecting our web shop with our ERP. You should bring in experience with what technical set-ups will be important for us since we are not educated enough to estimate and realize all aspects ourselves.We are planning to work on front end matters of this webshop ourselves, so there is no need for design experience.Just to make clear, it is crucial for us that you should bring in experience with Wordpress/Woocommerce, but especially JTL software. Since JTL is a German software provider it can be more difficult to familiarize oneself with this. We want to avoid working together with a partner that first has to figure out how JTL works.This project might be relatively compact and manageable since we are “only” talking about interfacing two systems. However we are planning to extend our range of niche shops with JTL Wawi and Woocommerce in the future this is why this cooperation can grow to a consistenst one. We will need an IT partner to set up and maintain these shops for us, so you cn regard this job as the test run for our future long-term cooperation.We are looking forward to you contacting us. If you can convince us about your experience with JTL Wawi and fundamental knowledge how to set up an eCommerce-webshop properly we are happy to review the current state of our system.Posted On: February 16, 2024 09:22 UTCCategory: Ecommerce Website DevelopmentSkills:WooCommerce, Ecommerce Website Development, WordPressSkills: WooCommerce, Ecommerce Website Development, WordPressCountry: Germany\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered are, introducing, novel-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
