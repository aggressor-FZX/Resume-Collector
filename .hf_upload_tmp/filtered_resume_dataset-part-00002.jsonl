{"content": "Delivered part, ioverview, the-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Part IOverview:In the first part of the final project, you will set up a complex scene by loading from two simple file formats—OBJ models accompanied by MTL material files. You will then apply lighting and texturing. When it is done, your scene will consist of a lit and colored car sitting on a lit and colored road next to a lit and textured stop sign, illuminated by a lit and colored streetlamp.Part 1-1: Setting your SceneThe first step is to review the starter code for this project. It contains a Model and a Face class and a series of calls that take in OBJ and MTL files and parses them into Model objects. Make sure you understand what this code is doing and what it returns so that you know how to use it in your program. You are welcome (but not required) to make any modifications to this code that you see fit. If you see any errors in this starter code or have any suggestions for improvement, let the instructor know.The starter code produces several console.log() statements that allow you to look at everything that has been processed from the files. You should study these statements to understand how the data in the Model class is organized. In particular, node how Model has an array of Face instances that contain all of the vertices, normals, and texture coordinates for each face in that model. The faces have all been triangulated for you, so you can just pass them directly into the vertex shader (either one face at a time or all at once) to draw your mesh using gl.TRIANGLES. Each face also has a corresponding material field that references one of the materials in the diffuseMap and specularMap fields in Model. You can use this information to look up the appropriate values for your lighting calculations on that face.Once you are comfortable with the above information, you should then render your models in a simple view to verify that your program is working. (HINT: Start with the stop sign, since it's the simplest mesh.) You will then want to set up your scene as shown in the demo video (you will incorporate the bunny in a later step). Once everything is set up correctly, you should then turn your attention to the MTL files.Diffuse colors in the form “Kd [R] [G] [B]”Specular colors in the form “Ks [R] [G] [B]”A diffuse texture map in the form “map_Kd [Map Image]”Part 1-2: LightingNext, you will place a point light at the top of your streetlamp to illuminate your scene. Your light should use Phong shading, and you should use the previously loaded diffuse and specular material colors from the MTL file. You may create your own ambient color.Allow the user to press the ‘L’ key to toggle the light on/off, but make sure that ambient light is still applied to your scene even when the light is off.Implementation Notes:Your lighting will likely look flat simply due to the normals on the provided models not being smoothed.Part 1-3: TexturingNext, you will implement texturing in your program using the texture coordinates loaded from the stop sign’s OBJ file, accompanied by the stop.png texture as specified in the map_Kd attribute of the material in stopsign.mtl.Implementation Notes:The texture coordinates in the OBJ file are flipped along the Y-axis; to get your final texture coordinates, you should subtract the V coordinates from 1.Part 1-4: Camera AnimationFinally, you will implement basic camera animation so that the user can view your scene from different angles. When the user presses the ‘C’ key, make the camera move along a circle on the XZ plane, while bobbing up and down slightly (along the Y-axis) as shown in the demo. (HINT: Think about how you might use the trigonometric functions.) The camera should not jump at all when the user starts or stops the animation and should preserve its current state.Part IIFinal Project Part II DemoLinks in starter fileOverview:In the second part of the final project, you will use a matrix stack to structure your scene through hierarchical transformations. You will also implement simple shadows, reflections, and refractions.Part 2-1: Hierarchical TransformationsPart 2-2: Hierarchical CameraPart 2-3: ShadowsPart 2-4: SkyboxPart 2-5: Reflections and Refractions (i.e. Environment Maps)Make bids and I will share more details and files also in chats.Happy Bidding!!!Budget: $80Posted On: February 20, 2024 18:16 UTCCategory: Video Game DevelopmentSkills:TypeScript, JavaScriptSkills: TypeScript, JavaScriptCountry: India\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

I don't need a GUI on the RDS desktop though.I have already using Auto Hotkey made a simple script as proof of concept which uses Winset \"Always On Top\" to make the 3cx GUI sit on top of the RDS session so the GUI can be used by the user---F12::WinRestore, 3CXWinGetTitle, title, Atitle = RegExReplace, title,#redacted this for upwork compatibility, removes invalid characters#If $titlenew = \"3CX\"Winset, AlwaysOnTop, On, A----This works, however F12 cant be captured on the Client machine when the RDS is active (have to press ctrl + alt + home first)I need call information from the softphone passing to the RDS session , and click to dial to work from the RDS SessionI want to build the app initially as this job, but there will be further functionality development for it in future.So here is how it should work::- Requirements - We need 2 Executables 1 which runs on the client machine, 1 that runs on the RDS. RDS has an environment variable I have setup \"CLIENTIP\" The RDS instance should setup a TCP connection (to a specific port so I can allow on firewalls) to the client executable so they can send each other date / commands. For the rest of this explanation, I will call them RDS.exe and CLIENT.exe RDS.exe should constantly check to see if the CLIENTIP environment variable has changed (if they have reconnected from a new device) and reestablish the TCP link if it has. If the link cannot be established then it should retry every ~ 10 seconds until it manages to establish.RDS.exe and Client.exe should run in the system tray with a green icon if the TCP connection is established, and a red icon if not, right clicking the icon should have the option to exit or restart, but no other GUI is needed at this stage.- Function 1 - Softphone Access in RDS - If the RDS.exe see's the user press F12, it should send a request to CLIENT.exe to Show/Hide the softphone. When CLIENT.EXE receives this request if softphone is currently open as a a window, then it should minimise it. If it is currently not open as a window it should check if it is running at all, and if not launch it. Then if minimised restore it, and use Winset, AlwaysOnTop to keep it above the RDS session display.So effectively when someone is in an RDS session they can press F12 to toggle the locally ran softphone displaying above their RDS session, or minimising out of the way.- Function 2 - Passing Caller ID - When the 3XC Softphone client on the client answers a call it can open a URL which contains the caller ID (“Settings - Integration - Open Custom URL” on the 3cx system) We need to associate the URL with CLIENT.exe so it sends the callerID here something like ACAMIDDLEWARE:[REDACTED_NUM] . When CLIENT.exe receives this URL it needs to send it to RDS.exe and RDS.exe needs to save it to a plain text file on the user profile %APPDATA%\\ACAMIDDLEWARE\\LastCallAnswered.txt (so that our CRM software can look at this when it needs to for integration reasons).We will add further functions utilising this in later versions, but for the initial development this is all it needs to do.- Function 3 - Click to dial from RDS - On the RDS I will associate Tel: to RDS.EXE , when someone clicks a tel: Link on the rds then RDS.exe should capture this and send it to CLIENT.exe which will execute the tel: Link and dial the number through the softphone which is running on the client.- Future work - In the future there will be more work where RDS.exe can SQL lookup the number sent to it from CLIENT.exe upon answering a call and display a ‘toast’ popup with relevant information and links in it on the RDS desktop. However I’m not too fussed about making this work on this initial job we can work on that for version 2. There will be further functionality added in future too.- Development Environment - I want this project built in the latest version of Visual Studio using c#, and I want all source code and project files supplied, we will still utilise you for all further development, but I am learning c# at the moment and want to be able to make small changes myself and understand how it works.Please provide a quote and timeframe, feel free to ask any questions.Posted On: February 23, 2024 14:19 UTCCategory: Tech SupportSkills:Windows App Development, C#Skills: Windows App Development, C#Country: United Kingdom\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

{"content": "Delivered seeking, chatgpt, just-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Hi,I am seeking a ChatGPT or just about any LLM specialist to craft AI-generated articles on a list of keywords that I give you. I currently have a list of about 32 keywords that I am trying to target and I need you to use your preferred tool of choice to write a [REDACTED_PHONE] word entry for each of them. You need to instruct your tool of choice to write the articles in a way that mentions the target keyword as much as possible without compromising on the readability of the article.At the beginning and end of the article, it should also mention the company name that provides the service the article is about and link to its site. All in all, it's a very straightforward process, just automating the writing of content marketing articles. I was doing it myself but it's getting too cumbersome submitting several prompts to ChatGPT 4.0 for each article (as it can't write [REDACTED_PHONE] word articles in one-go, you have to break them into separate sections and them combine them afterwards).Please also make sure that the articles aren't written too generically. You want part of your prompt engineering to include the act of instructing it to write in a more human manner that will relate to the readers, otherwise it'll just end up writing the articles in a way that is now easily detectable as AI-generated content by most people.I've found that finding content relevant to the keyword online and copy-and-pasting/feeding it the information from those articles makes it so it doesn't give you the most generic information imaginable. You just tell it to then re-write it in a fashion that sounds more human and it will do a relatively good job of that. Then just have it insert the company in one of the paragraphs in the introduction and conclusion. The introduction needs to be subtle and relevant, I do not want the articles coming off as too \"salesy\".I am looking to pay $3 per finished article and will have probably another couple hundred keywords that I'll need to target in the near future. Assuming you can churn out a finished article every 10-15 minutes like I was doing, this job will be paying about $12-$18 an hour.

All our major competitors such as Peerspace and Giggter are decentralized platforms that work by allowing location hosts to list their space on the platform and get bookings from the site traffic much like Airbnb. The problems with this model is it leaves our competitors with no control over their product quality, pricing, customer support, expansion and more.Oasis On Location on the other hand is a completely centralized platform. We source all of the locations on our platform directly from short term hosts leaving us the ability to offer universal customer support, higher quality control, pricing control, and several other unique abilities.To add to this we are currently developing an AI integration that will allow production companies to upload their whole script. From there the AI will decode the script of all the locations and how they are described and link it to our massive portfolio to automatically source options from each scene in the script. Once this is complete this innovation will make us by far the most versatile and functional location rental platform currently on the market.Another massive advantage we have over our competition is full control over our expansion. We partner with top rental companies and acquire hundreds or even thousands of properties at a time. Since the start of 2024 we have brought on over 7,000 Film Locations, 4,000+ Yachts, and 2,000+ Cars, from the outreach force of just one agent.Our goal is simple. We want to be the largest location rental company in the world and with our strategy we are around [REDACTED_PHONE] good connections away from doing that.To achieve our goal we are looking to build a team of highly effective and motivated sales professionals to perform to key tasks in the company:POSITION 1 - New Location Outreach: This may possibly be the easiest sales job ever… or at least the easiest thing I’ve ever sold by far. Our service has no upfront cost, the short term host has the ability to accept or dismiss any booking and once they say yes we list all their spaces for them. Simply put, there is no way for an owner to lose money or time, there is only something to gain. With this offer I have historically received a 15%-25% positive response rate on cold outreach… meaning 1-3 people out of 10 don’t just respond but they respond with a positive go ahead to use the location or locations for film. Another key point is since the offer is so non-invasive and beneficial, if the owner has several properties or even thousands we can usually acquire all of them at once.Compensation: We have three compensation levels for agents that source new properties1 - 99 Locations = 30% of all profits from the locations for life[REDACTED_PHONE] Locations = 40% of all profits from the locations for life1000+ Locations = 50% of all profits from the locations for lifePOSITION 2 - New Member Outreach: The second key position needed is outreach agents to find new production companies and location scouts to use our services. This requires a simple outreach explaining the service and that we offer FREE location sourcing. From there the goal is to get them to create a FREE account on our site and start booking rentals.Compensation: As payment for finding new members the responsible Oasis Agent will receive a lifetime 10% commission on the profits from any rental said production company ever books through the Oasis On Location platform.We have designed our compensation structure to be very lucrative for building significant long term passive income for an elite select few. BOTH POSITIONS ARE COMMISSION ONLY + BENEFITS.Since the conversation rates of our offer are so high we do not need a massive team to complete the goal.

Also check if its possible to allow editing the email address's local-part in Roundcube natively.1) The plugin's default reply setting is to write from the custom email address but not the regular identity. Although this can be switched in the plugin's settings, it does not work for a multi-user setup of webhosting companies as some clients wish to reply from the custom email address which is the current default setting while others want to reply from their regular identity/address. This means, there needs to be a toggle in Roundcube's settings to choose one or the other option.→ Can this option be added to Roundcube's UI settings when adding the plugin?→ An even better solution may be to integrate half of the functionality in Roundcube natively by making the local-part of the email address editable. A toggle option in the settings shall determine to either always reply with the default identity or with the custom local-part the email was sent to before is got forwarded to the mailbox (as long as the domain-part is the same. Otherwise, it would require the custom_from plugin for a totally virtual alias). This saves setting up several identities for each custom email address the user receives emails to.The benefit is to communicate with each service provider by an individual email address so when the personal email address is leaked, it can easily be blocked by filtering as the main mailbox remains unknown which is a great spam protection.2) The plugin loses the modified email address and switched back to the user's default identity when saving a draft, closing the editing window and reopening the draft.→ Can this be fixed?You would need to set up a Roundcube installation and test the changes before creating a pull request on GitHub.Also modify the plugin's (and i.a. Roundcube's) ReadMe instructions accordingly and include sample pictures so that people have a visual impression of the functionality.As this will not only help myself but become public domain, it is a voluntary job that I'm happy to kick-start with a small budget.Send me a proposal when you wanna fight spam and consider the above useful and yourself skilled for the job.Posted On: February 14, 2024 09:25 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:PHP, JavaScript, CSSSkills: PHP, JavaScript, CSSCountry: Germany\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

This application will be used on Android tablets to facilitate physical inspections of labels on boxes, ensuring that the internal factory labels match the shipping labels. The goal is to automate the verification process, enhance accuracy in order fulfillment, and maintain high-quality control standards.Project Requirements:1. OCR Implementation: The app must incorporate advanced OCR technology to accurately read and extract text from two different types of labels on boxes. The OCR should be highly reliable in various lighting conditions and able to recognize texts effectively from different label designs.2.

It must accurately match these fields to verify that the internal factory label corresponds with the shipping label.3. User Interface: The app should provide an intuitive interface prompting the user to scan the labels similar to credit card autofill scans. It must guide users through the scanning process, ensuring ease of use and efficiency.4. Verification and Reporting: After scanning, the app will compare the extracted data fields with those in the external data source and inform the user whether the information matches (correct) or not (incorrect). This feature is critical for quality control and order fulfillment verification.5. Order Fulfillment Tracking: The system needs to keep track of order fulfillment status, as an order may include multiple boxes. The labels will contain data fields that associate them with the completion of the order, and the app must manage and track this association accurately.6. Device Compatibility: The app will be deployed on preselected Android tablets, allowing for a focused approach on compatibility and formatting issues.7.

This may involve refining complex edges or softening boundaries for a more natural integration.Global Adjustments:Apply overall adjustments to the composite to unify the look and feel of the image. This includes tweaking the contrast, brightness, and color temperature to ensure the entire scene looks cohesive.Filling in Details:Use generative capabilities to fill in any missing details or to correct imperfections within the composite. Please mention \" I am next level\" when applying for this job. This can be particularly useful for adding realistic elements that were not present in the original images.Final Review:Conduct a thorough review of the composite, ideally on different displays and under various lighting conditions, to catch any inconsistencies. Adjust as necessary to ensure the final image meets the desired level of realism.Additional Tips:Encourage the use of non-destructive editing techniques to allow for adjustments and revisions without permanently altering the original images.Emphasize the importance of patience and attention to detail throughout the composting process. Realistic photo compositing often requires fine-tuning to achieve a seamless blend.Hourly Range: $8.00-$10.00Posted On: February 17, 2024 11:27 UTCCategory: Image EditingSkills:Manipulation & Compositing, Adobe Photoshop, Photo Manipulation, Product Photography, Photo Editing, Graphic DesignSkills: Manipulation & Compositing, Adobe Photoshop, Photo Manipulation, Product Photography, Photo Editing, Graphic DesignCountry: Australia\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}
