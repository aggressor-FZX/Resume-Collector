{"content": "Delivered globe, amp, citizen-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Globe & Citizen Web3.0 Job Posting# WHAT:Welcome to Globe & Citizen! An international startup seeking to become Web3.0's premier distributed news network. Our company is based around 3 projects:- \"Celebrity Fanalyzer\" (to be rebranded as \"Globe & Citizen: News of Our World\" in 2025)- Layer8 (A browser based end-to-end-encryption proxy)- Crypto Native Corporation Portal (A web portal for creating Crypto Native Corporations)What is a Crypto Native Corporation (CNC)? A CNC is a company that has an analogous structure to any corporation except that it can be, from the very beginning, globally distributed because it uses crypto as it’s primary medium of economic exchange and governance (see the attached extended explanation, “What_and_Why_of_CNCs.docx”).# WHY:To improve our world and get rich while we do it.# WHO:1 – 4 junior web3 developers with big ambitions! The ideal candidate will be very ambitious and not afraid to learn! Currently the team is comprised of 6 developers and 4 auxiliary members. Spread around the world in Nigeria, Singapore, Venezuela, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Togo, Brazil, and Canada.# WHERE:Fully remote. You will meet with your team lead for one on ones weekly and join a weekly team meeting. In addition, you will meet with me (the Chief Policy Officer & financier) at least monthly. Ad hoc meetings are also encouraged. All financial transactions will be done through UpWork. We communite using Discord as well and you will upload all your work to one of Globe & Citizen’s Github repos.# PROJECT SUMMARIES:## “Globe & Citizen: News of Our World”Globe & Citizen is dedicated to sanitizing user data so that the anonymized aggregate can be publicly analyzed so that users can decided their own truth about world events. In order to accomplish this, you will complete development of [REDACTED_URL] which is actually Globe & Citizen in stealth mode (see the attached). Your will:- Converting Celebrity Fanalyzer into a DAPP so that the monthly competitions can be run using Ethereum instead of fiat currency (what we have been doing).- Experimenting with how anonymized data can be analyzed and then reflected back to users.- Optimizing. Celebrity Fanalyzer is a Progressive Web App built using Quasar and VueJS## “Layer8: A Browser Based E2E Encryption Proxy”Built using Golang compiled to WASM, Layer8 routes http traffic through a custom server that strips identifying headers before sending the encrypted payload on to a service provider. This has the effect of separating your true identity from your content choices online. Once sanitized, user data can then be aggregated for public analysis and presentation by a service provider.## “Crypto Native Corporation Portal (CNC Portal)”Our goal in 2024 is to complete development of our MVP (Celebrity Fanalyzer + Layer8) while pretending to be 3 different companies entering into smart contracts with each other. Governance and finance for these three pretend “companies” will be done using the CNC Portal that YOU will build using the attached mocks as a guide.The CNC is to be what Github is to Git for anyone wanting to build open source. In short, though a centralized platform is planned, it will facilitate decentralized companies spread around the globe and this is our vision. Why a centralized platform? Because, in the words of Signals founder, “We should accept the premise that people will not run their own servers by designing systems that can distribute trust without having to distribute infrastructure. This means architecture that anticipates and accepts the inevitable outcome of relatively centralized client/server relationships, but uses cryptography (rather than infrastructure) to distribute trust.”# WHY SHOULD I JOIN GLOBE AND CITIZEN?We are an early stage company and your primary task will be to iterate on functionality. This is the most exciting part of software development because it is functionality that defines a product in the minds of users! We are also sustainably self funded which means that we put a premium on the learning and development of our people. We hope you will learn, experiment and bring forward your ideas!# HOW TO APPLYTo begin with, you will join either team Globe&Citizen or team CNC Portal (thougheventually you are like to participate in all projects).1) Apply to this post -- see the 4 questions2) Attend a 1 hour interview.# ABOUT THE COMPANY:Globe & Citizen first came into being October 2022 when the first hires joined on Upwork (all of whom are still with the company 16 months later!) It’s a worker driven company seeking to pioneer a fully remote, globally distributed, business model.# REQUIREMENTS:English. A robust Internet connection. Relevant development experience. And, again, be ready to learn, and learn, and learn.

However, we don't have an Instructional designer within our team, who will be able to review and make final edits to those paths. The topics are mostly technical (e.g. PhotoVoltaic installations), but there might be a few Soft Skills paths. Overall, there are about 22-30 paths each taking learners 20-50 mins to completeThe way I would imagine it, the authors prepare everything information-wise. But since they are not experts in interactive digital education, this is where we need your support. Once the authors make the first cohesive version of the path, you will take over. Ideally, you can finalize the path yourself - if needed, rewrite some texts, add questions, and make it pretty. If information is missing or you suggest adding something that you aren't able to add yourself, we can get in touch with the authors to do it. There probably won't be a lot of fact-checking on writing about technical topics from scratch, since authors are all subject matter experts. We need someone to take over the final preparations of the paths to make sure they are consistent, well-written, and dynamic.My feeling is that it's easier if all the communications go through me so that you don't have to be in touch with 20 people :) The first paths are ready, and we can hand them over to you in batches.

They meticulously document their findings, including steps to reproduce issues and any relevant information that can help developers understand and address the problems.Key responsibilities of a manual tester may include:Understanding project requirements and specifications.Developing test cases and scenarios based on requirements.Executing test cases manually to identify defects or issues.Logging defects and communicating them effectively to the development team.Participating in test case reviews and providing feedback on testability aspects.Collaborating with developers, business analysts, and other stakeholders to ensure comprehensive test coverage.Conducting regression testing to ensure that previously identified issues have been resolved and new changes haven't introduced new problems.Providing input for improving testing processes and methodologies.Ensuring that software meets quality standards and user expectations before release.Manual testers play a crucial role in the software development lifecycle by providing valuable feedback and helping to ensure that software products meet quality standards and user expectations.

{"content": "Delivered backgroundseeking, support, with-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"BACKGROUNDSeeking support with bringing a new business concept to life through a document or slide deck that captures what, who, how, why, so what for a new integrated coaching business in the love and relationship space.This work is in prep for working with other creatives on brand identity, tone of voice, messaging etc. Whereas contractors those backgrounds are welcome to apply, we aren’t quite ready and settled to commit to formative brand work yet (nor the price tag that comes along with that.)IDEAL CANDIDATE PROFILEThe ideal person has experience in the sacred spirituality, wellness, and/or coaching space. But they may also just be a very intuitive person and storyteller and writer who personally connects with the mission and potential impact of a coaching platform that spans spirituality, neuroscience, media, and social justice.Regardless, the ideal candidate will be willing to engage in live discussions as a way of mind-melding to effectively capture the essence of the brand, and be disciplined enough to play back progress for asynchronous collaboration and feedback along the way.PREFERRED ENGAGEMENT MODELWe would prefer a fixed fee engagement model for this given the exploratory scribe-to-story nature of the work. We also expect and will only work with writers who have learned how to use AI to assist the note taking and editing process (vs those who would use AI as a replacement for actual writing).TLDR we could do this ourselves by simply recording our thoughts and using AI to transcribe and produce copy. But great stories are sculpted by great questioners, interviewers, and seekers; value the interviewing and facilitation skills, the art of great copy, and the accountability that comes with partnering with another creative on this. Hence this call is for the right partner to prepare and deliver the right questions via a series of sessions (30-45 mins, depending on the topic) over the next few weeks.PHASE 0: TO GET STARTED- Align on Scope, Plan, Pricing, and Sign Contract and NDA- Scope Re-clarification: Align on timeline for delivery, progress milestones and acceptance criteria for the target deliverables.- Project Kickoff to setup and review workspace (including access to available materials), schedule sessions, and expectations around communication and collaboration.- Asynchronously: Sign-off on Scope, Timeline, Fund Initial MilestonePHASE 1: INTERVIEW TO INSIGHTSWeek 1 (1-2 sessions)- Topic 1a: Background & Why- Topic 1b: Business Mission & Target Impact- Week 1 Conversation Summary & Playback DeliveredWeek 2 (1-2 sessions)- Topic 2a: Target Audience (Broad)- Topic 2b: Ideal Client Profile(s) (Specifics)- Week 2 Conversation Summary & Playback DeliveredWeek 3 (1-2 sessions)- Topic 3a: Differentiation & Positioning- Topic 3b: Brand Personality & Essence- Week 3 Conversation Summary & Playback DeliveredWeek 4 (1-2 sessions)- Session 4a: Products & Services (Full Suite)- Session 4b: Launch Offering- Week 4 Conversation Summary & Playback DeliveredPHASE 2a: RESEARCH & STRATEGY (Optional, Skill Required)Week 5 (Research, No Live Sessions)- Contractor conducts market research to understand potential positioning opportunities- Contractor works on and submits recommendations for positioning, messaging, differentiationPHASE 2a: COPYWRITINGWeek 6 (Async Chats, No Live Sessions)- Contractor submits first draft (along with Loom video walk-through explaining approach)- Contractor receives initial feedback (in anticipation of 3 additional revision rounds in the final phase)Week 7-8 (Pre-Scheduled Live Sessions, for Feedback Walk-Through & Discussion)Pre-scheduled revision round walk-throughs and final drafts.- Revision Round 1: (i) Work on Revisions (ii) Submit Feedback & Receive Async Comments, then (iii) Join Pre-Scheduled Session for Live Discussion of Feedback- Revision Round 2: (i) Work on Revisions (ii) Submit Feedback & Receive Async Comments, then (iii) Join Pre-Scheduled Session for Live Discussion of Feedback- Revision Round 3: (i) Work on Revisions (ii) Submit Feedback & Receive Async Comments, then (iii) Join Pre-Scheduled Session for Live Discussion of FeedbackFinalize edits, and submit final deliverables: Company Introduction (Deck) and About Me Landing Page.ADDITIONAL NOTESFinally, the above structure is mainly to illustrate the desired elements of the engagement—- a balance of live and asynchronous “downloads”- the expectation of call summaries (which AI + light editing can be useful in delivering) and the need for progress being made weekly- the need for spaciousness and breathing room between sessions, so the story can “settle”- and clarity re: topics we expect to cover and be reflected in the final deliverable.To apply please share your experience with similar projects in the past, your relationship with the coaching platform’s matter, and your bid for the entire project.Hourly Range: $15.00-$39.00Posted On: February 18, 2024 21:52 UTCCategory: Marketing CopywritingSkills:Content Writing, Brand Positioning, Copywriting, Storytelling, BiographySkills: Content Writing, Brand Positioning, Copywriting, Storytelling, BiographyCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

The individual should have a strong track record of successfully securing government contracts in both the US and the EU, demonstrating their ability to navigate the complex legal and regulatory frameworks in each jurisdiction.In the United States, experience with federal procurement processes, such as those outlined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), is essential. This includes familiarity with various contract types, such as fixed-price contracts, cost-reimbursement contracts, and time-and-materials contracts. Additionally, knowledge of small business set-aside programs, socioeconomic contracting requirements, and compliance with Buy American Act provisions is crucial for success in securing US government contracts.Moreover, understanding the EU public procurement directives and regulations is vital for navigating the complexities of securing government contracts in the European Union. Familiarity with the different procedures used in EU member states, such as open procedures, restricted procedures, competitive dialogues, and innovation partnerships, is essential. Furthermore, knowledge of EU competition law and state aid rules is critical for ensuring compliance when pursuing government contracts in the EU.The ideal candidate should possess expertise in crafting compelling proposals that meet the specific requirements outlined in government solicitations. This includes demonstrating an understanding of the evaluation criteria used by government agencies in both the US and the EU. Moreover, experience in engaging with government contracting officers, understanding their needs, and building strong relationships with key stakeholders is invaluable for success in this field.In summary, a person experienced in securing government contracts in both the United States and the European Union should possess comprehensive knowledge of federal procurement processes in the US, familiarity with EU public procurement directives and regulations, expertise in crafting competitive proposals, and a proven track record of successful contract awards in both jurisdictions.Budget: $55,000Posted On: February 17, 2024 01:42 UTCCategory: Business & Proposal WritingSkills:Business Strategy, Proposal Writing, Transportation, Automotive, Energy & Utilities, Aerospace, Contract Drafting, Contract Management, Tech & IT, WritingSkills: Business Strategy, Proposal Writing, Transportation, Automotive, Energy & Utilities, Aerospace, Contract Drafting, Contract Management, Tech & IT, WritingCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

We want it to have efficient cooling that is quiet, as well as a display that looks great. It should be built out of materials that make it feel high quality and solid. We want it to be lightweight and easy to store, but still be powerful and have a sleek design, and boast a long battery life as well as quick charging times. Basically...the holy grail of laptops, if that makes sense.The main limiting factor is the price of this...we were hoping to have this product for sale at around $600-$800. I was very loose with the requirements, using general terminology, for this reason - if your team could find that balance between power and affordability, that would be great. Of course selling it at around $600 would mean manufacturing it at around $300-$400. (All prices in USD)It is okay if you borrow components that are already made from other manufacturers to make this, and we can definitely incorporate diversification under one product. (How Apple charges more money for more storage on the same iPhone, for example.)We plan to fund this buy using income from pre-orders...so keeping the development and manufacturing as cheap as possible is essential.As of right now, I have three major concerns:1. How much will this cost to develop?2. Is this even possible with today's technology?3. When we are ready to develop this, how long will it take?For a little bit of context, this is a start up, and we have no connections anywhere...we're building this up from scratch.If you have any ideas as to what could help make this laptop more appealing, please do add those as you go. Like I said before, we want this to be the \"holy grail\" of laptops.If you could contact me that would be appreciated about this job, that would be appreciated. That way, we will be able to discuss your capabilities and how much you can help.Thank you for your time reading this.Posted On: February 17, 2024 01:41 UTCCategory: Electronic EngineeringSkills:Circuit Design, Design Simulation, Circuit Diagram, Digital Electronics, Power Electronics, Printed Circuit Board, Electronic Circuit Design, Electrical Engineering, Microcontroller Programming, Electronic Design, PCB Design, Proteus Design Suite, Electrical Design, Laptop, ElectronicsSkills: Circuit Design, Design Simulation, Circuit Diagram, Digital Electronics, Power Electronics, Printed Circuit Board, Electronic Circuit Design, Electrical Engineering, Microcontroller Programming, Electronic Design, PCB Design, Proteus Design Suite, Electrical Design, Laptop, ElectronicsCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

Detailed representations of power inverters and other components of the microgrid system will be included.Different operating modes of the network and fault scenarios will be simulated to test the performance of the proposed fault detection and classification algorithm. This will involve setting up various fault conditions and disturbances to evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness.The algorithm for fault detection and classification, based on the Boosting Ensemble Method and minimal overlap discrete wavelet Transform, will be implemented in MATLAB. This will involve processing the current signals from both ends of the line, extracting features using signal processing methods, and training the Brownboost ensemble algorithm.The algorithm will be tested and validated using the simulated microgrid scenarios. Performance metrics such as fault detection accuracy, classification results, and robustness to noise and synchronization errors will be evaluated during the simulations.The results of the simulations will be analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in fault detection and classification in microgrids.

This project aims to delve into the intricacies of fan culture, fandom communities, and the impact of music on individuals’ lives. Given the sensitive nature of intellectual property rights and potential legal implications surrounding the portrayal of real-life entities, I recognize the necessity of expert legal counsel to navigate these complexities.**Project Overview:**The proposed book revolves around a group of avid fans of a well-known rock band, exploring themes of passion, loyalty, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy within fan communities. While the narrative primarily focuses on fictional characters and events, it incorporates elements inspired by real-life experiences and the cultural influence of the music industry.**Scope of Legal Assistance:**1. **Intellectual Property Rights:** Assessing the usage of copyrighted material, trademarks, and likenesses associated with the rock band and its members to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.2. **Defamation and Privacy Concerns:** Reviewing character portrayals, plotlines, and any potentially controversial content to mitigate risks of defamation, invasion of privacy, or misrepresentation of real individuals.3. **Licensing and Permissions:** Advising on the necessity of obtaining licenses or permissions for references to song lyrics, album titles, concert venues, and other copyrighted material, as well as negotiating agreements where applicable.4. **Fan Community Representation:** Providing guidance on accurately depicting fan culture and community dynamics while respecting the rights and privacy of real-life fans and enthusiasts.5. **Contractual Agreements:** Drafting or reviewing contracts with publishers, distributors, and other relevant parties to safeguard my rights and interests in the creative work.**Qualifications:**I am seeking a legal professional with expertise in entertainment law, intellectual property rights, and contract negotiation, preferably with prior experience advising authors, artists, or media producers in similar creative projects. Familiarity with the music industry and fan culture dynamics would be advantageous.**Timeline and Budget:**The project timeline is flexible, with an estimated duration of legal consultation spanning several months to accommodate manuscript development, revisions, and publishing preparations. The budget allocation for legal services will be negotiated based on the scope of work, hourly rates, and anticipated complexities of the project.**Conclusion:**In summary, I believe that securing comprehensive legal advice is essential to the success and integrity of my fictional book project involving fans of a popular rock band. By engaging a qualified legal consultant, I aim to ensure regulatory compliance, mitigate legal risks, and uphold the creative vision while respecting the rights of all parties involved.I look forward to discussing this proposal further and collaborating with a skilled legal professional who shares my passion for storytelling and commitment to ethical representation.Budget: $50Posted On: February 22, 2024 11:04 UTCCategory: Intellectual Property LawSkills:Copyright Prosecution, Legal, Art & Design, Media & Entertainment, Copyright, Intellectual Property LawSkills: Copyright Prosecution, Legal, Art & Design, Media & Entertainment, Copyright, Intellectual Property LawLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

In this study, you will evaluate the quality of explanations generated by machine learning models that justify their decision on specific tasks of author attribution. The task consists of two phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2. In the following, we will explain each.Note: Because a portion of the data comes from social media posts, it is possible that you come across potentially distressing content or ideas. However, this content might not be extreme and can be found in public social media. By accepting to perform this task, you agree to participate in this study; you have the right to stop annotating at any time.In both phases, you will solve 70 tasks, each taking between 15 and 20 minutes.Phase 1:This phase consists of solving two types of tasks that we explain below (Task 1 and Task 2). You will be solving 50 tasks in total; each task is expected to take a maximum of 20 minutes to complete.Task 1:Task context. Law enforcement has identified a forum post we call a Query document (Q document). An investigation has resolved the origin of the post to a particular device such that it must have been written by one of the four potential authors: A, B, C, or D. Law enforcement need to know if there is evidence to support identifying one of the suspects for further investigation.Task description. Your task is to read the Query document as well as the posts from each author and determine which of the candidate authors is likely to have written the Query documents. In some of these tasks, you will also be given extra explanations of the linguistic, stylistic, and/or semantic features of the Query document, as well as posts from each author.Then, only if this information is given, you will have to answer a set of questions on the quality of explanations.Task 2:Task context. Same as Task 1 contextTask description. This time, you will be presented with an AI agent’s prediction of the Query document's author and the machine-generated explanation that justifies this prediction. Your task is to judge different aspects of the explanation you just saw with respect to the prediction.Annotation PlatformOn the annotation platform, click on the “Author Attribution Explanation” project. You will then be prompted with a summary of the instructions, and then you can start the evaluation. The total 50 tasks are composed of 10 sets of 5 tasks each, sequentially presented to you. Each set consists of the same Query and Author documents. The first task in the set consists of you solving the Type 1 task without any provided explanations. The second and third tasks in the set consist of you solving the Type 1 task but with explanations provided by two systems (describing the documents’ writing style and the overall similarity). The fourth and fifth tasks are of Type 2, where we additionally show the AI agent prediction by the two systems, and you have to answer questions regarding the prediction.Noe: More details on this Phase can be found in the Phase 1 Study Instruction and Info Sheet in the attachments.Phase 2:For each task, you will be presented with a query document and four candidate documents, along with the AI’s prediction of the author of the query document with explanations of the decision. Then, you will reason about the AI’s prediction on a follow-up document. You are to guess what the AI would predict. In total, you will solve 20 tasks.Note that your task is NOT to annotate the correct answers to the follow-up questions but rather guess the Robot's answers based on its explanation and answer in the starter text.Budget: $500Posted On: February 13, 2024 18:12 UTCCategory: Experimentation & TestingSkills:Content Writing, Linguistics, Writing, Natural Language ProcessingSkills: Content Writing, Linguistics, Writing, Natural Language ProcessingLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

We ran into a snag when this guy went to Russia and UpWork cancelled the contract because of that. All the work is complete, but we are having troubles getting this working correctly. It's through a system called Mumara and uses Contabo in some way to help with this...I don't know much of the technical side of it.Here is what was done:Milestone 1 - Domain Configuration.Buying the domain names and configuring the DNS. You will need to buy the 5 domains (1 for the main application, 4 for the sending servers) and either give me access to the DNS control panel, or I will create a Cloudflare account that you will point the domains to so I can configure them.I will configure the domain names with all the necessary records (DKIM, DMARC, SFP, and others) and prepare them for connecting to the servers.Milestone 2: - Main server configuration, Email Platform Install and Configuration. AI Server setup.Prepare and configure the Main server for integration with the sending infrastructure, install the EMS (Email marketing software), and prepare the server for SMTP connection with the sending servers.Install and configure the AI algorithms.In this step, you will need to buy the main VPS and the AI Core VPS.In this step, you'll need to get the main server and the email software license ($27 per month).Milestone 3: - Sending infrastructure servers set up and configuration, AI algorithms integration.Configure the 4 sending SMTP servers, tie them into a complete sending infrastructure, configure the AI algorithms for the infrastructure inbox management make all the necessary configurations for a 10/10 anti-spam reputation. In this step, you will need to buy the VPSs that will be configured for sendingMilestone 4: Connect the sending servers to the main application and configure the sending infrastructure with the platform.Integrate the sending servers with the EMS, create and configure the SMTP accounts inside the software, create the bounce accounts, and make all the necessary adjustments inside the software.Milestone 5:Ip and Domain warm-up, reputation establishment. I will do all the necessary procedures to have a 100% inbox rate for our email servers and sending domains.While the servers are being established there will be a system tutoring course where I will teach you everything you need to successfully master the system.After the completion of the project, you will have my 30 days of guidance on the safe usage of the system and supportWE NEED HELP WITH THIS ASAP!

The Size, Industry, and Geography fields will have a predefined drop-down list, while other fields will be free text.

I hope to hire a US qualified family law attorney who could spend 2 or 3 hours coaching me on how to (i) present my divorce case to the family law judge, (ii) defend myself from the false counterclaim (iii) conduct a direct examination and potentially cross examine of myself, my wife, and my daughter. If you have time in the next few days, I believe this coaching could be accomplished in 4 to 5 hours. Thank you for your consideration.Hourly Range: $200.00-$300.00Posted On: February 18, 2024 16:01 UTCCategory: Business & Corporate LawSkills:Contract DraftingSkills: Contract DraftingLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}
