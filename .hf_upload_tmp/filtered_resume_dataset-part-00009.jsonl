{"content": "Delivered max, and, recently-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Hi,I’m Max and I recently created a company centered around multimedia and content creation. I have been living as a digital nomad and working in this field for the past few years and I now want to scale things up.As part of growing my business, I’d like to find reliable editors to work with. I want to grow in the industry and undertake more/bigger projects.Disclaimer: this isn’t going to be full time to begin with. In the long run I would love to be able to hire you, but at the moment I just need one or two freelancers to delegate work to.What I want from you:- Experience: I need you to have a track record in video editing and to be able to showcase previous projects. Preferably you work on the Adobe Suite, but if you use other softwares, we can always make do. You don’t need to work for Hollywood but I still need solid skills.- Flexibility: as I’m sure you know, some clients are harder to deal with or have very short deadlines. I would like someone who is ready to work on short notice and review their work if necessary.- Creativity: I would like someone who will find the little extra touch to stand out. UGC is everywhere and it is more important than ever to come up with new ideas to secure the most interesting partnerships.- Versatility: we will create for many different clients, so you will need to be able to adapt to any type of project, whether it is regarding the format or the topic. Usually it will be shorts etc., so feel free to show more of your fast-paces motion design videos.- Patience: I reiterate that this won’t be a straight line to a big salary, and some periods might be very empty. As a growing business we may have to accept unfavorable terms from time to time; so expect pretty variable pays throughout the year.What you get from me:- Interesting (not all the time) projects that you don’t need to look for yourself.- Someone available and comprehensive to work with. I have experience in this field and I know the struggles that can come with it. I will be there to discuss and assist in any way I can.- Most of the pay you will generate: I would obviously take a cut off of projects you would undertake as a remuneration for running the logistics of the business, but I aim to make it as fair as possible to you.- Possibility to grow: once again you won’t make millions to begin with, but as our revenues increase, I hope to reward you as best as I can. Also, if our partnership is fruitful, there is a possibility for you to obtain a better position as one of the first members. Maybe managing a team yourself or something like this, we’ll see in due time.Little pluses:- Language proficiency: I personally speak English, French and Spanish. You obviously must be fluent in English, but it’d be great if you master other languages so we can comfortably approach other clients.- You live in Europe or SEA: I’m from Europe and will be living part time in SEA in the foreseeable future. It would be great to have the possibility to meet if we plan on working together long term.- You have other skills: I mainly need video editors as this is the most profitable niche, but I also undertake projects including Voice Over, Graphic Design and Web Design. It will be very handy if you can do any of these as well.Also remember that the criteria above are more of a wishlist rather than mandatory criteria; feel free to reach out even if you don’t tick all the boxes :)Please send me your resume/portfolio/links to your best work, and start your application with “YOU NEED ME BECAUSE..” + the reason why you want to onboard the project, so I know you read my (way too) long offer. I am not only looking for employees but rather long term partners, and I hope you share my vision.I’m looking forward to hearing from you,Max.Hourly Range: $5.00-$15.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 20:30 UTCCategory: Video EditingSkills:Video Editing, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, English, Motion GraphicsSkills: Video Editing, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, English, Motion GraphicsCountry: Belgium\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

It’s an ambitious vision and a long way to go. To take the first step we are starting by automating issue investigations with an AI agent.**About you**- You are a skilled UX & UI designer with at least 5 years experience with digital products.- You are experienced with going from a product idea - user flow - wireframes - UX.- You understand how to work in an agile way. i.e. we don't do long 4-5 week projects to get to something useful. We optimize for wireframes / UIs that are immediately testable by a user, we get feedback and we improve.- You are familiar with software engineers or the concepts are familiar enough that you can learn quickly. They are our target users, when you listen to their feedback and use technical terms it should be clear to you what they mean.- Gen AI is a totally new thing, what worked in UX/UI design in the past may not work here. You are thoughtful and think about first principles versus pushing a set process.- You are able to work US West Coast hours. Our daily standup is at 3PM PST which is 11pm in the UK, midnight CET and 7AM in Singapore. It's much easier if you're already in North/Central or South America.**About this interview project**Rather than doing a long interview process, we'd rather see your work and this will be paid time.You should spend no more than one day on this task, the budget is $350.We will select 5 people to work on this project with a submission deadline. You must submit prior to the deadline. We'll select the designer with the work we like the most for the long term role.If selected, you will receive a document with a user flow diagram and an explanation of how it works. Please spend no more than a day and work on a single screen (you can choose which one) and submit your design.UX is MUCH more important that UI. A wireframe is perfectly fine. A well designed information architecture with good ideas is much better than some very pretty UI that doesn't make sense.We will pick the person who we feel gets the idea most and communicates well.Tips- You are strongly encouraged to use generative AI like ChatGPT and Dall-E etc. We don't consider this cheating, please do it.- Document the user interaction, frameworks like: 'what the user sees, what the user does, what the product does' are very helpful.- If you're unsure about something, make an assumption and go ahead. Just state your assumptions in your final work. There's no wrong or right, we just want to see how you think and how it comes through in your work.**Deliverable**A Figma file that you should consider a presentation.

The location in question is failing miserably and your contract with this company is a last ditch effort to bring this location’s productivity up, or else it will be shut down. The designers haven’t submitted a good, usable design to headquarters in months.When you begin your work figuring out what’s going wrong, you immediately see many red flags. Records show that employees call in sick frequently, come in late, leave early, and several complaints between employees have been filed by Human Resources.When you visit the office, you are immediately struck by what a dismal environment you see. Florescent lights flicker over beige cubicles, ambient noise of machines buzzing and phones ringing fills your ears, and employees look bored and tired. You notice only one communal work space piled over with old projects and clutter. The supply room is sparse. The break room is small and cluttered, and nobody is using it.You decide to interview employees and learn some alarming information; employees mostly work alone, do not seem to know each other well, some outright dislike one another, they report having no fun or enjoyment while at work, and some suffer chronic work-related health problems such as migraines and back pain. You notice wonderful diversity among employees, yet nobody seems to appreciate or understand the unique perspectives of their colleagues.It is clear to you that this office is not conducive to the kind of creative collaboration necessary to pull it out of its slump. Using what you know about the importance of art in the world and workplace, you will come up with a plan to solve these problems.InstructionsAssemble a portfolio of recommendations on how to turn this office from a non-productive location to a creative hub of productivity.Portfolio should include the following parts:Part 1Compose an introduction (1-2 paragraphs) indicating the historical impact of art on modern culture, society, and the workplace.Part 2Create an infographic on how to use the arts to promote the following within the company:Collaboration between colleaguesMulticulturalism/diversityCommunity engagementPart 3Construct a visual model using diagram software of the ideal creative workspace that includes the following areas:A space for individual workA space for collaborative workPublic interaction areaVisual display areasNOTE - You may add additional areas as you see fit.Each area in the workspace must be clearly numbered and the following questions answered:How will this space be used and by whom?What Elements of Art and Principles of Design will be used in this space?How does the space promote creativity and collaboration?How will the arts be used to promote creativity and well-being?Part 4Create a descriptive resource list with contact data of at least six funding possibilities for art events.

Typically achieved measurable time savings (e.g., up to 30-60%) through automation.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"I am a developer with 40 years experience, mostly on .Net platform. I have a small consulting company, and a client has asked me to develop a new forms-based site.I'd like to develop some competency around Power Platform and I'm thinking this is a good fit. I can get up to speed quickly, but I know that there will be gotchas that an expert can help me with in a way that will save me time and money.Here are a few examples of the type of questions/problems I might have:- I'd like to have someone look at the overall project description to see if they agree that Power Pages is a good solution and whether they see any hurdles I might run into later.- I have developed a proof of concept app and am currently working on a multistep form with some subgrids. I don't quite have it working correctly yet and some troubleshooting will help.- I want to authenticate this app with oauth2, which is not supported. If an applicant has the knowledge regarding this, they could assist with setting up ADB2C for oauth2 with a 3rd party product.- There will be some workflow associated. If you know flows, that's great, though I could find someone else if need be.We can communicate by email and/or zoom or Teams.I expect this to be a couple of hours per week. I'd like to get responses to my questions within 24 hours, but can work around someone's schedule as need be.Here is a brief description of the project from early on if you'd like to offer any observations as part of your response, though that is not required.Thanks for your consideration.Clients are looking to get certified by submitting a set of forms (5 or 6). A certification is earned when I particular set of forms is approved by admins. (here, a \"form\" is like a long paper form consisting of many questions).Some certifications have forms that must be done in order, some can be done in parallel.Admins provide feedback/comments on submitted forms and refer them back to clients. The comments are added to each question in the form.Clients revise forms until they are accepted.Once all required forms are accepted, the certification is earned.A PDF is created from the final certification forms as a record.Forms have text boxes, text areas, checkboxes, radio buttons, and tables.The questions on the form have multiple parts. For example, one question might have two text areas, an array of checkboxes, a set of radio buttons, and a table (tabular data such as lists of contacts).Tables can have a fixed number of rows. Cells should be able to contain sets of controls (e.g. radio buttons) as well as textboxes.Not a lot of form logic, though some textboxes are sums of others. Some validation.A web app is used by clients to manage their side of this.They log in with SSO from Neon CRMThey can see certifications earned, expirations, etc.They can see certifications in process and which forms have been started/revised/approved.They can start a new certificationApp should be responsive so it can be used across multiple device sizesQuestions:- Is PowerApps a good platform for this?â—‹ Power Pages for client-facing part?â—‹ Automate for workflow and notifications?â—‹ Dataverse for data?â—‹ PowerApps or PowerPages for admin functions? If PowerApps, canvas or model-driven?â—‹ Will maintenance be easier vs. an asp.net solution? Easier to modify forms/schema/workflow, potentially without developer assistance?- Integration with CRMâ—‹ Want to authenticate with NeonCRM with SSO and access client info from there with little or no replication in the app.â—‹ Neon does OAuth2. PowerPages requires OIDC. Best practices for setting up SSO?â—‹ Best practice for linking together customer data in CRM and authenticated user data in Dataverse?- Formsâ—‹ Best way to design forms and create schema? Forms are currently paper.â—‹ Best way to organize data given it is hierarchical (e.g. forms, questions, tables)? I've made some progress here with a table for the form, tables for use in subgrids as part of questions, a form per question, and multistep form pages. Have not connected schema to users, organizations, workflows, multi-form certifications, etc. yet.Hourly Range: $20.00-$50.00Posted On: February 19, 2024 21:21 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:Microsoft Power AutomateSkills: Microsoft Power AutomateCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

Now that you are on board I can show you this…”Your new CEO hands you a piece of folded paper he’d pulled from his jacket pocket. It's the second day in your CFO role, working with a CEO who was entrepreneurial, to put it mildly.The business is a rocket ship. Explosive organic growth and a carnivorous scaling strategy. A potent pairing. The company had reached $200mn annual GMV in 3 years with thousands of B2C transactions monthly. It was scaling big but immature.You opened the piece of paper and read it. It was a copy of a letter to a commercial partner dated six months earlier, promising them a payment in another six months as part of the settlement of a large negotiation.Accounting alarm bells were ringing. The number in the letter was huge. $5.7m.You don't know yet what audit materiality will be, but you are certain it would be less than $5m. At first glance, some of this should have been in reserve by now. But you were sure it wouldn’t be in any forecasts.You were going to ask the CEO if this had been accounted for, but you already realized this was unlikely. You wouldn’t be having this conversation if it had.So you skipped a step and said:“Tell me you aren’t the only person who knows this exists.”He laughed: “No, of course not...”I relaxed a bit.“... now you’ve seen it too.”A real eye-opening moment. But it gets more interesting. Earlier that day one of the 3 accountants on your team came to you and said:“There is a big problem in our financials. There’s a hole in the balance sheet. I think it’s big. At least $2m. I discovered a prepaid expenses account on the balance sheet but since we had to implement the new system we did not find time to work out what happened.”Current Scenario:You were brought in to help the company gear up for their largest funding round in 18 months and one of the first tasks as CFO is to create a budget to present to the board, however, you quickly realised that you are faced with one of the worst cases of what it looks like when financial controls don’t keep pace with the growth of a business.Questions:For the next meeting with the CEO,a.how would you go about breaking the news about the issues you have found?b.Propose a roadmap for next 3-6 months, along with dates and milestones. Feel free to make assumptions as deemed necessary.c.If the CEO seems to have unrealistic expectations and not interested in any sort of controls fearing it might slow down the business, how would you handle this?d.Outline your key strengths in helping deliver in this role.e.Outline the resources you would need, and any challenges you foresee in taking on or during this role.Format:This is a simulation and discussion exercise, where you are expected to present your views and plans. You can use any format you deem appropriate for presenting or communicating your views.

It incorporates ergonomic design principles to ensure effective stretching and decompression of the spine, neck, and shoulder areas, promoting better posture, relieving pain, and enhancing flexibility.Key Features:Adjustable Spine Cradle: At the heart of the FlexiSpine Plus is an ergonomically designed, adjustable spine cradle that supports the natural curvature of the back while providing gentle yet effective stretching to relieve pressure on the vertebrae.Integrated Neck Support : Attached to the top of the spine cradle is an adjustable neck support that cradles the neck, providing targeted stretching and decompression to relieve tension and improve alignment.Shoulder Stretch Loops: On either side of the spine cradle, retractable shoulder stretch loops allow users to position their arms in a way that promotes optimal shoulder stretching and alignment, enhancing the decompression effects across the upper body.Material & Build: Made from high-quality, durable materials that are lightweight yet sturdy. The FlexiSpine Plus features a comfortable, foam-padded cradle and support areas, with a flexible yet strong frame designed to accommodate various body types and sizes.Portability : Designed for easy assembly and disassembly, the FlexiSpine Plus is compact and portable, allowing users to enjoy the benefits of neck, shoulder, and back stretching at home or on the go.Adjustability: With multiple adjustment points, users can customize the stretch intensity and positions to suit their comfort levels and specific needs, making it suitable for beginners to advanced users.Visualization:Imagine a sleek, modern-looking device with a curved, spine-friendly base that extends upward to form a gentle arc. At the top of this arc, a cushioned support cradles the neck, adjustable to fit different neck lengths. From the sides of the arc, two flexible arms extend outwards, ending in padded loops designed to gently pull the shoulders back and down, encouraging a natural, open chest position and aligning the spine, neck, and shoulders. (Start your reply by \"Flexi\" to prove you went through the entire job post). The entire device is covered in a soft, breathable fabric for maximum comfort during use. Its color scheme is calming, with choices of serene blues or greens, emphasizing a feeling of tranquility and healing.Budget: $300Posted On: February 22, 2024 20:08 UTCCategory: Product & Industrial DesignSkills:Concept Design, Product Design, 3D Design, 3D Modeling, Product Development, 3D Rendering, Adobe Photoshop, PrototypingSkills: Concept Design, Product Design, 3D Design, 3D Modeling, Product Development, 3D Rendering, Adobe Photoshop, Prototyping\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

I note that Model Articles for your company have been filed which means that Article 10(2) is the relevant provision. This Article advises that a quorum for a directors meeting can be fixed from time to time but sets the default quorum as 2 directors. Previously it was considered that article 7(2) of the Model Articles permitted decision making by 1 director where there is only 1 director of the company. This has now been interpreted to mean that a company must have at least 2 directors to make valid decisions (such as agreeing to enter into a mortgage) where this provision has not been varied in the model articles.As you are the sole director of your company, without amendment it means that any board meetings and minutes that you complete, do not currently comply with the articles of the company.In order to proceed, we need for you to arrange for your company’s articles of association to be varied by way of a written resolution, and the resolution to be filed at Companies House, so as to disapply the quorum requirement under article 10(2).
