It’s an ambitious vision and a long way to go. To take the first step we are starting by automating issue investigations with an AI agent.**About you**- You are a skilled UX & UI designer with at least 5 years experience with digital products.- You are experienced with going from a product idea - user flow - wireframes - UX.- You understand how to work in an agile way. i.e. we don't do long 4-5 week projects to get to something useful. We optimize for wireframes / UIs that are immediately testable by a user, we get feedback and we improve.- You are familiar with software engineers or the concepts are familiar enough that you can learn quickly. They are our target users, when you listen to their feedback and use technical terms it should be clear to you what they mean.- Gen AI is a totally new thing, what worked in UX/UI design in the past may not work here. You are thoughtful and think about first principles versus pushing a set process.- You are able to work US West Coast hours. Our daily standup is at 3PM PST which is 11pm in the UK, midnight CET and 7AM in Singapore. It's much easier if you're already in North/Central or South America.**About this interview project**Rather than doing a long interview process, we'd rather see your work and this will be paid time.You should spend no more than one day on this task, the budget is $350.We will select 5 people to work on this project with a submission deadline. You must submit prior to the deadline. We'll select the designer with the work we like the most for the long term role.If selected, you will receive a document with a user flow diagram and an explanation of how it works. Please spend no more than a day and work on a single screen (you can choose which one) and submit your design.UX is MUCH more important that UI. A wireframe is perfectly fine. A well designed information architecture with good ideas is much better than some very pretty UI that doesn't make sense.We will pick the person who we feel gets the idea most and communicates well.Tips- You are strongly encouraged to use generative AI like ChatGPT and Dall-E etc. We don't consider this cheating, please do it.- Document the user interaction, frameworks like: 'what the user sees, what the user does, what the product does' are very helpful.- If you're unsure about something, make an assumption and go ahead. Just state your assumptions in your final work. There's no wrong or right, we just want to see how you think and how it comes through in your work.**Deliverable**A Figma file that you should consider a presentation. I should be able to view it and understand what your ideas are.Budget: $350Posted On: February 20, 2024 00:55 UTCCategory: UX/UI DesignSkills:Figma, UX & UI, User Interface Design, Web Application, Business with 1-9 EmployeesSkills: Figma, UX & UI, User Interface Design, Web Application, Business with 1-9 EmployeesCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered about, working, towards-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

You'll need to update the domain's DNS settings to point to SiteGround's servers.Retrieve SiteGround Nameservers: Log in to your SiteGround account and navigate to the domain management section. Take note of the nameservers provided by SiteGround.Update Nameservers on GoDaddy: In your GoDaddy account, find the domain associated with your landing page and update the nameservers to the ones provided by SiteGround. This change may take some time to propagate across the internet.Transfer Landing Page Files: Using FTP or File Manager in cPanel, transfer your landing page files from your GoDaddy hosting to your SiteGround hosting account. Make sure to replicate the directory structure and permissions as needed.Import Database (If Applicable): If your landing page relies on a database, export the database from GoDaddy's hosting control panel and import it into your SiteGround hosting account. Update any configuration files to point to the new database location if necessary.Update Configuration Settings: Update any configuration settings within your landing page files to reflect the new hosting environment, including database connection details and file paths.Test Your Landing Page: Once the migration is complete, thoroughly test your landing page on SiteGround to ensure all functionalities are working correctly.Update DNS Records (Optional): If your landing page utilizes specific DNS records (e.g., MX records for email), make sure to update them in your SiteGround account accordingly.Monitor for Propagation: Keep an eye on your domain's DNS propagation status to ensure the changes have fully taken effect. This process can take up to 24-48 hours to complete.Cancel GoDaddy Hosting (If Desired): Once you've confirmed that your landing page is successfully hosted on SiteGround and all necessary data has been migrated, you can cancel your hosting subscription with GoDaddy if you no longer wish to use their services.Budget: $20Posted On: February 22, 2024 17:32 UTCCategory: Web DesignSkills:GoDaddy, WordPressSkills: GoDaddy, WordPressCountry: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered effectively, move, your-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I will provide the high-resolution background and the product photo, your job will be to composite. I have attached a sample picture and the background photo so you get the idea.Only apply if you are an expert and have complete knowledge of lighting, shadows, highlights, and realistic composites.IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ BELOW CAREFULLY.My Minimum Expectations for Photo Compositing:Initial Preparation:Start by ensuring the product image and the new background share similar lighting conditions and perspectives. This foundational step is key to a believable composite.Lighting and Color Matching:Adjust the lighting and color temperature of the product to harmonize with the background. Use AI-powered features to analyze and apply changes that align with the desired lighting conditions and color schemes.Shadow and Highlight Refinement:Create or modify shadows and highlights to match the lighting of the background. Consider using generative features for adding realistic textures or shadow details that conform to the lighting environment.Saturation and Color Adjustments:Modify the saturation and colour tones to ensure the product blends seamlessly with its new environment. AI suggestions can be useful for achieving a harmonious colour balance.Detail and Texture Matching:Adjust the clarity and sharpness of the product to match the background's texture. This step is crucial for maintaining consistency in the level of detail between the product and its surroundings.Edge Blending:Smoothly blend the edges of the product with the background, especially in areas where the transition needs to be seamless. This may involve refining complex edges or softening boundaries for a more natural integration.Global Adjustments:Apply overall adjustments to the composite to unify the look and feel of the image. This includes tweaking the contrast, brightness, and color temperature to ensure the entire scene looks cohesive.Filling in Details:Use generative capabilities to fill in any missing details or to correct imperfections within the composite. Please mention \" I am next level\" when applying for this job. This can be particularly useful for adding realistic elements that were not present in the original images.Final Review:Conduct a thorough review of the composite, ideally on different displays and under various lighting conditions, to catch any inconsistencies. Adjust as necessary to ensure the final image meets the desired level of realism.Additional Tips:Encourage the use of non-destructive editing techniques to allow for adjustments and revisions without permanently altering the original images.Emphasize the importance of patience and attention to detail throughout the composting process.

The location in question is failing miserably and your contract with this company is a last ditch effort to bring this location’s productivity up, or else it will be shut down. The designers haven’t submitted a good, usable design to headquarters in months.When you begin your work figuring out what’s going wrong, you immediately see many red flags. Records show that employees call in sick frequently, come in late, leave early, and several complaints between employees have been filed by Human Resources.When you visit the office, you are immediately struck by what a dismal environment you see. Florescent lights flicker over beige cubicles, ambient noise of machines buzzing and phones ringing fills your ears, and employees look bored and tired. You notice only one communal work space piled over with old projects and clutter. The supply room is sparse. The break room is small and cluttered, and nobody is using it.You decide to interview employees and learn some alarming information; employees mostly work alone, do not seem to know each other well, some outright dislike one another, they report having no fun or enjoyment while at work, and some suffer chronic work-related health problems such as migraines and back pain. You notice wonderful diversity among employees, yet nobody seems to appreciate or understand the unique perspectives of their colleagues.It is clear to you that this office is not conducive to the kind of creative collaboration necessary to pull it out of its slump. Using what you know about the importance of art in the world and workplace, you will come up with a plan to solve these problems.InstructionsAssemble a portfolio of recommendations on how to turn this office from a non-productive location to a creative hub of productivity.Portfolio should include the following parts:Part 1Compose an introduction (1-2 paragraphs) indicating the historical impact of art on modern culture, society, and the workplace.Part 2Create an infographic on how to use the arts to promote the following within the company:Collaboration between colleaguesMulticulturalism/diversityCommunity engagementPart 3Construct a visual model using diagram software of the ideal creative workspace that includes the following areas:A space for individual workA space for collaborative workPublic interaction areaVisual display areasNOTE - You may add additional areas as you see fit.Each area in the workspace must be clearly numbered and the following questions answered:How will this space be used and by whom?What Elements of Art and Principles of Design will be used in this space?How does the space promote creativity and collaboration?How will the arts be used to promote creativity and well-being?Part 4Create a descriptive resource list with contact data of at least six funding possibilities for art events. Each resource should briefly explain the resource and how the employer might use it.Budget: $100Posted On: February 23, 2024 15:05 UTCCategory: IllustrationSkills:Graphic DesignSkills: Graphic DesignCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered scenarioyou, are, independent-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I have a small consulting company, and a client has asked me to develop a new forms-based site.I'd like to develop some competency around Power Platform and I'm thinking this is a good fit. I can get up to speed quickly, but I know that there will be gotchas that an expert can help me with in a way that will save me time and money.Here are a few examples of the type of questions/problems I might have:- I'd like to have someone look at the overall project description to see if they agree that Power Pages is a good solution and whether they see any hurdles I might run into later.- I have developed a proof of concept app and am currently working on a multistep form with some subgrids. I don't quite have it working correctly yet and some troubleshooting will help.- I want to authenticate this app with oauth2, which is not supported. If an applicant has the knowledge regarding this, they could assist with setting up ADB2C for oauth2 with a 3rd party product.- There will be some workflow associated. If you know flows, that's great, though I could find someone else if need be.We can communicate by email and/or zoom or Teams.I expect this to be a couple of hours per week. I'd like to get responses to my questions within 24 hours, but can work around someone's schedule as need be.Here is a brief description of the project from early on if you'd like to offer any observations as part of your response, though that is not required.Thanks for your consideration.Clients are looking to get certified by submitting a set of forms (5 or 6). A certification is earned when I particular set of forms is approved by admins. (here, a \"form\" is like a long paper form consisting of many questions).Some certifications have forms that must be done in order, some can be done in parallel.Admins provide feedback/comments on submitted forms and refer them back to clients. The comments are added to each question in the form.Clients revise forms until they are accepted.Once all required forms are accepted, the certification is earned.A PDF is created from the final certification forms as a record.Forms have text boxes, text areas, checkboxes, radio buttons, and tables.The questions on the form have multiple parts. For example, one question might have two text areas, an array of checkboxes, a set of radio buttons, and a table (tabular data such as lists of contacts).Tables can have a fixed number of rows. Cells should be able to contain sets of controls (e.g. radio buttons) as well as textboxes.Not a lot of form logic, though some textboxes are sums of others. Some validation.A web app is used by clients to manage their side of this.They log in with SSO from Neon CRMThey can see certifications earned, expirations, etc.They can see certifications in process and which forms have been started/revised/approved.They can start a new certificationApp should be responsive so it can be used across multiple device sizesQuestions:- Is PowerApps a good platform for this?â—‹ Power Pages for client-facing part?â—‹ Automate for workflow and notifications?â—‹ Dataverse for data?â—‹ PowerApps or PowerPages for admin functions? If PowerApps, canvas or model-driven?â—‹ Will maintenance be easier vs. an asp.net solution? Easier to modify forms/schema/workflow, potentially without developer assistance?- Integration with CRMâ—‹ Want to authenticate with NeonCRM with SSO and access client info from there with little or no replication in the app.â—‹ Neon does OAuth2. PowerPages requires OIDC. Best practices for setting up SSO?â—‹ Best practice for linking together customer data in CRM and authenticated user data in Dataverse?- Formsâ—‹ Best way to design forms and create schema? Forms are currently paper.â—‹ Best way to organize data given it is hierarchical (e.g. forms, questions, tables)? I've made some progress here with a table for the form, tables for use in subgrids as part of questions, a form per question, and multistep form pages.

A gen AI–powered tool can summarize key themes across the leases, such as how much rent is expected monthly or what market forces (such as local environmental, social, and governance compliance laws) could affect leases. Additionally, the tool can scan across leases for a particular parameter (for example, all leases with a rent price per square foot below a certain level) and generate tables of information. At that point, professionals can examine the information the AI tool has compiled.langchain lambda openAIBuild the stateless chatbot using langchain lambda openAI deployed on AWSYou should able to show me the example before we can start the projectHourly Range: $5.00-$30.00Posted On: February 19, 2024 21:20 UTCCategory: Machine LearningSkills:Chatbot Development, OpenAI CodexSkills: Chatbot Development, OpenAI CodexCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered shared, example, building-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Now that you are on board I can show you this…”Your new CEO hands you a piece of folded paper he’d pulled from his jacket pocket. It's the second day in your CFO role, working with a CEO who was entrepreneurial, to put it mildly.The business is a rocket ship. Explosive organic growth and a carnivorous scaling strategy. A potent pairing. The company had reached $200mn annual GMV in 3 years with thousands of B2C transactions monthly. It was scaling big but immature.You opened the piece of paper and read it. It was a copy of a letter to a commercial partner dated six months earlier, promising them a payment in another six months as part of the settlement of a large negotiation.Accounting alarm bells were ringing. The number in the letter was huge. $5.7m.You don't know yet what audit materiality will be, but you are certain it would be less than $5m. At first glance, some of this should have been in reserve by now. But you were sure it wouldn’t be in any forecasts.You were going to ask the CEO if this had been accounted for, but you already realized this was unlikely. You wouldn’t be having this conversation if it had.So you skipped a step and said:“Tell me you aren’t the only person who knows this exists.”He laughed: “No, of course not...”I relaxed a bit.“... now you’ve seen it too.”A real eye-opening moment. But it gets more interesting. Earlier that day one of the 3 accountants on your team came to you and said:“There is a big problem in our financials. There’s a hole in the balance sheet. I think it’s big. At least $2m. I discovered a prepaid expenses account on the balance sheet but since we had to implement the new system we did not find time to work out what happened.”Current Scenario:You were brought in to help the company gear up for their largest funding round in 18 months and one of the first tasks as CFO is to create a budget to present to the board, however, you quickly realised that you are faced with one of the worst cases of what it looks like when financial controls don’t keep pace with the growth of a business.Questions:For the next meeting with the CEO,a.how would you go about breaking the news about the issues you have found?b.Propose a roadmap for next 3-6 months, along with dates and milestones. Feel free to make assumptions as deemed necessary.c.If the CEO seems to have unrealistic expectations and not interested in any sort of controls fearing it might slow down the business, how would you handle this?d.Outline your key strengths in helping deliver in this role.e.Outline the resources you would need, and any challenges you foresee in taking on or during this role.Format:This is a simulation and discussion exercise, where you are expected to present your views and plans. You can use any format you deem appropriate for presenting or communicating your views. The presentation will take place with the recruitment representative.Budget: $200Posted On: February 13, 2024 11:36 UTCCategory: Financial Management/CFOSkills:Investment Strategy, Shareholder Relationship, People Management, Business Plan, Lead GenerationSkills: Investment Strategy, Shareholder Relationship, People Management, Business Plan, Lead GenerationCountry: United Arab Emirates\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered background, glad, you-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Context: General tech role"},{"role":"user","content":"Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Hello,I am working on a series of children's books as gifts to my family members. The idea is to create these books to honor special family members that the future generation never got to meet. For example, a book all about who my Grandfather was that my mother could read to my children to teach them about how cool of a life her father lived. We have written the stories and are working with artists on the images for the actual book, but we still need an attractive cover art for the front and back.These should be in a watercolor illustration style of art similar to the examples of some of the internal art attached.For the cover, I am imagining a nature and green theme like the primary color for the books cover should be shades of green when you see it on a shelf. For back cover specifically, I am picturing a young boy sitting with his back against the base of a large tree reading. I like the idea of the tree being a \"Family Tree\" to represent the huge family that came off from him. I think it would be far too busy of an image to try and include real images of the family members (60+) or even their names, but thought maybe we could have the major branches of the tree represent his 8 kids and have branches off of each of them representing their kids and so forth. Maybe each branch ends with an Apple and we shape it in such a way that the tree looks well balanced with the spacing of the apples and branches. I like that idea, but I am open to any thoughts you may have to make these better.For the front, I don't really have any ideas on what it should look like. Something to represent his life, but also not trying to just recreate something from inside the book. I want it to be bright and happy. To make the reader want to pick it up and look inside. I am also trying to finalize the Title of the book.I am alright if you want to use AI or other tools to help with the creation of the cover.Here is the story from the book to give you more information:Page 1: On January 31, 1931, a boy named Donald Leo Hastings was born in the small town of Alhambra, Illinois. It was a quiet country life for a boy, but Don found ways to fill his days with dreams and adventures.Page 2: His loving mother Jen helped foster a love of reading andstorytelling. The adventures he found in books and stories nurtured a passion for words for the rest of his life. For over 50 years, he spent breakfast completing the daily crossword puzzle.Page 3: The woods, streams, and fields of rural Illinois cultivated a love for being outdoors and a curiosity for the animals he found there. Hiking, fishing, horseback riding, and hunting were his daily pursuits.Page 4: Even when Don wasn’t looking for adventure, it seemed to find him. One sunny day while riding his scooter, Don was stopped by a young girl named Harriet Zoleman. Harriet was visiting her cousin and wasn’t going to miss a chance to ride on Don’s scooter.Page 5: That scooter ride was the start of a 74-year friendship. It was only 3 years after that first meeting, Don and Pat secretly eloped to Arkansas with their two best friends. Don wore his father’s suit and Pat her best Sunday dress.Page 6: Like the wheat and corn fields Don grew up running though, their family grew. First two boys, Donald Jr. and Douglas, just as Don Sr. wanted. Then Pat got her wish for six girls Kathleen, Pamela, Elizabeth, Celeste, Kimberly, and the youngest Jennifer.Page 7: With so many mouths to feed, life wasn't always easy. Don always said, “We didn’t have 2 nickels to rub together but we were as happy as two church mice”, because their home was rich with love and laughter.Page 8: Don worked many hard jobs to care for his family. He found work on a chicken farm, in the local butcher shop, and for the Illinois Central Railroad as a telegrapher and mail clerk.Page 9: Don’s love for the outdoors eventually led him to his dream job as a State of Illinois Game Warden. He patrolled the same woods, streams, and fields he grew up in protecting animals that couldn’t protect themselves.Page 10: Even Don’s family helped with his job often caring for injured animals he brought home. Some even became unusual family pets: raccoons, bear cubs, monkeys, and deer, to name a few.Page 11: When Don retired from Conservation, he had worked his way up to the position of Director overseeing the entire Illinois department and all its officers. He and Pat were ready for their next adventure. They bought a Winnebago and set off to travel the world.Page 12: The incredible wildlife they encountered on their travelsinspired their next journey; creating a magazine for Game Wardens and Conservation. It was called The International Game Warden and is still circulated in over 30 countries today.There are two more pages talking about his love of golf, his passion for telling stories to his family, and about his teachings of living fully and never giving up to his large family.Thank you!Budget: $50Posted On: February 14, 2024 16:39 UTCCategory: IllustrationSkills:Watercolor, Illustration, Book Cover, Drawing, Graphic DesignSkills: Watercolor, Illustration, Book Cover, Drawing, Graphic DesignCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hello, working, series-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Next along this horizontal layout might be the first major revenue contract via television: basketball in 1951. Supreme court cases Alston vs. The NCAA and supreme court case NCAA vs. Oklahoma Board of Regents gave the schools competing across the nation, the right to complete control over how much they appeared on television. I also would like the collage to include the written timeline of these events; the years they happened. Another key date would be dates which include the death of a player, Ray Dennison of Fort Lewis A&M Aggies in 1955.

You should place them parallel to each other with enough space between them and the walls.Walking Space: Ensure at least 3 feet of walking space in front of and behind the racks for easy access. This is essential for maintenance and to comply with safety standards.Electrical Outlets:7-110V Outlets: These are typically used for general purposes and can be evenly distributed along the wall behind the racks. It's wise to place them about 18 inches above the floor, making them easily accessible for plugging in equipment.2-240V Outlets: These outlets are required for high-power devices, such as servers or high-end computing equipment, and should be placed near the server rack for direct access.Design Considerations:Ensure enough space for airflow around the racks to prevent equipment from overheating.Consider adding a small desk or workspace for tasks like setting up equipment or troubleshooting if space permits.Lighting should be adequate, significantly above the racks, to assist in maintenance tasks.If possible, include cable management solutions to keep the room organized and safe.Budget: $350Posted On: February 13, 2024 23:42 UTCCategory: 3D Modeling & RenderingSkills:3D Lighting, 3D Floor Plan, Photorealistic Rendering, 3D Modeling, Blender, 3D Design, Architectural DesignSkills: 3D Lighting, 3D Floor Plan, Photorealistic Rendering, 3D Modeling, Blender, 3D Design, Architectural DesignLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered need, room, design-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I don't have the time to edit them, I want them slightly edited to make them better than the raw photo. Price is negotiable.- Make sure the photos are straightened- Exposure is correct- Vibrancy increase- Tasteful edits, nothing too extreme.I included two attachments, one of an unedited photo, and the other is the edited photo to show you what kind of edits I am looking for.The edits I made in Lightroom on this photo to get this look:Lighting adjustments. Please note these are an example guideline for the example photo. Different sets of photos likely require different edits. The main point is that the edits are generally minimal in appearance. Natural feel.- Photo was underexposed so I brought the exposure up.- Highlights and whites were too high so I brought them down.- Shadows down a bitCurves:- Not much, just a tiny raise in the blacks to make them mildly grey. Brown skin can turn orange with curves so just be careful.Color:- Vibrancy IncreaseIn the mixer, I pushed the greens hue to positive 36+ for a slight teal color. Play around with that for the greens of plants.- Boosted saturation on greens and blues.For colors, use your taste and best judgement. There is no color grading.The only effect is a little bit of grain. No clarity, texture, vignette.Enable Lens correctionFinally, the geometry.For portrait photos please crop the photo to 4x5. Landscape photos you can leave, or crop to 5x4 by taste.In the edited photo, I adjusted the rotation to keep the photo straight.

(one image)Similar to the wayfinding page, we plan to implement a \"Tesla\" builder for the signage page. Customers should easily select products, choose colors, and decide on internet connectivity. The goal is a quick and straightforward process with fewer options.We believe one image should sufficiently convey your ideas.Current page appearance: [REDACTED_URL] Product page: Mockups/ideas required. (one image)This page requires thoughtful consideration. The goal is to present all products, services, and licenses in a fast and user-friendly manner. We are considering hiding certain elements, such as prices (requiring login to view). The aim is to create a more inviting and user-friendly interface that encourages customers to explore our products.Current page appearance: [REDACTED_URL] Individual product page: Mockups/ideas required. (one or two images?)This is where customers navigate to individual products and configure them accordingly. The current page layout is non-standard and needs to resemble other ecommerce sites more closely. We aim to reduce options, create a friendly appearance, and simplify the process.Current product page appearance: [REDACTED_URL] Map model page: Mockups/ideas required. (one or two images?)For each \"digital wayfinding\" product, a corresponding \"map model\" is necessary. We are struggling to simplify this for customers. While a map is required for each product, it only needs to be created once for each location, a concept we need to clarify. The current calculator serves as a proof of concept, but we aim to make it more user-friendly. We are considering options like \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large\" map models with fixed costs. Users can customize further by clicking to run the calculator.This is our most critical product, and it needs to be simpler, more user-friendly, and easily understandable.Current appearance: [REDACTED_URL] you & send your ideas and thoughts and past work,Idea is that we get someone who we feel understand what we are looking for, and can maybe give us a teaser/thoughts/ideas that will inspire us to launch this as a bigger project.We will take meetings with a selected few that we think fits this project,Best regards,JohanBudget: $400Posted On: February 14, 2024 10:58 UTCCategory: UX/UI DesignSkills:Adaptive Web Design, Mobile App Design, Web Design, User Flow, Wireframing, User Experience Design, User Interface Design, Prototyping, Mockup, Responsive DesignSkills: Adaptive Web Design, Mobile App Design, Web Design, User Flow, Wireframing, User Experience Design, User Interface Design, Prototyping, Mockup, Responsive DesignCountry: Sweden\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hello, are, seeking-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
