However, with the little knowledge I have, I have been trying to design my rental apartments myself with the concept of wabi-sabi.The design is very minimal and aesthetic but all the necessary elements are still available. 60% of the design is complete need help with 40%.I have been using arches as my primary shape, and the furniture designs are low in height to give a feeling of high ceilings. The lighting consists of bamboo pendant lights and straw lights, but I feel the design still lacks something and doesn't feel complete. I am stuck with designing two bedrooms one with a queen-size bed and the other with a twin bed aswell. I have created some designs, but I am not completely satisfied with them as I feel it’s not cohesive and complete, and I'm having a hard time. I have three colors in mind: white, pine wood color, and brass color, with white being the main color (60%), pine wood being the secondary color (30%), and brass being the highlight color (10%).I am looking for someone who can improve the existing design so that all the interiors align with the arch shape and wabi sabi concept. I need sizes for the furniture, complete design for one queen bedroom and one twin bedroom, entrance reception, lighting , rendering and improvements for other rooms with necessary requirements. I have already purchased most of the items, and I can send pictures as well.Requirement and expectation:1. Alignment with Concept: Ensure that all interior designs align with the concept of wabi-sabi, focusing on simplicity, natural elements, and imperfection with the current design.2. Improvement of Existing Design: Enhance the current design to make it feel complete and cohesive. Address any perceived shortcomings and ensure that the design reflects the concept and vision accurately.3. Furniture Sizing: Provide specifications for the sizes of furniture pieces to ensure they fit well within the space and contribute to the desired aesthetic.4. Complete Bedroom Designs: Develop detailed designs for both the queen-size bedroom and the twin bedroom, considering factors such as layout, furniture placement, color scheme, and lighting.5. Color Scheme: Incorporate the specified color scheme of white (60%), pine wood (30%), and brass (10%) throughout the design, with white as the dominant color and brass used as accents.6. Utilization of Purchased Items: Work with the items you've already purchased to integrate them seamlessly into the design, ensuring they complement the overall aesthetic.7. Necessary Improvements: Identify and implement any necessary improvements or additions to other rooms, taking into account functional requirements and aesthetic preferences.8. Collaboration and Communication: Maintain open communication throughout the design process, considering your input and feedback to ensure the final result meets your expectations.9. Budget Considerations: Keep in mind that the apartment is leased, and therefore, expenses for permanent alterations should be minimized. Prioritize design elements and modifications that can be easily removed or reversed without significant cost or damage to the property. Focus on cost-effective solutions and utilize existing resources wherever possible to stay within budget constraints.Budget: $200Posted On: February 16, 2024 13:16 UTCCategory: Interior DesignSkills:Hotel Design, Interior Design, SketchUp, Residential Design, 3D Rendering, Commercial DesignSkills: Hotel Design, Interior Design, SketchUp, Residential Design, 3D Rendering, Commercial DesignCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered have, keen, interest-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Once a way forward has been decided I would then require supplier liaison, product acquisition and e-commerce publication support.2) While the above product updates are occurring I would like to co-currently work on building a social media following and CRM list so that we can do a targeted campaign launch with the new product offerings.Once these two projects are complete I then have a digital marketing roadmap I would like to implement such as user tracking, retargeting ads, content marketing such as blogs, social media, EDM, automated emails triggers etc.Thank you for taking the time to read my ad!

I am looking for more designs. I have ideas for the next collection, I need a graphic designer/illustrator to realize them. Trying to run a business on a shoestring budget is no fun, but creativity charges me on.I created a couple of designs in AI which I would have liked to use but there would be way too many corrections needed. So I would like them re-created, digitally hand drawn if you will. The graphic can be just line art. It would have enough detail to love it and wear it. I would like to have the design embroidered, but too much color doesn't do well in embroidery (apparently).Someone rightly said, I am creating a Culture, a tribe, with these designs. These designs would capture the attention of 24yr - 45yr old's who love the casual attire and already purchase printed clothing. Visit the site, take in the designs already there. Create a story in your mind's eye, how does this topic (and attached files) resonate with you?Do you have an idea you want to talk to me about, let's talk.Is there a collaborative idea brewing in your mind, let's hear it.What I have in mind for the next collection - 'Clan' - which clan do you belong to. Running a business on a shoestring budget is no fun, and very limiting. I am looking for 1 design to start the new collection. If you have opened the attachments, then you might be able to visualize it. For each of the designs on my site, they each could be a character in an untold story. Each new design, would open the next chapter in the story.When I mentioned 'wear it', these designs will be printed/embroidered on t-shirts, hoodies and sweatshirts to begin with.Check this out:[REDACTED_URL] is a new business with which I want to deliver endless creativity. I welcome any questions you might have.What I need:1 concept design, similar to the attached filesFull res PNG, JPG, digitized embroidery file, transparent backgroundThose whom I shortlist, I will have a meeting with you online. I would like to see your portfolio's as well. I live in Melbourne, if that's you, let's catch up over coffee.I have worked with certain graphic designers repeatedly on touchups and fixes.

Preferably, well-off parents who have children studying international courses and looking for premium tutors. I am a partner for a medium-sized tutoring company based in China and am currently looking for more students. Prices and commission are discussed further below.- Not much worked is needed. Just need to read this relatively long job description (sorry! I think it’s quite relevant) Only a simple recommendation through something like WeChat or a phone number and if the deal is successful you will get your commission. We can exchange WeChat and discuss this further if it interests you.- These courses can be any international course, like IGCSE, IB, iA-level, AP, and even younger years like IBMYP. We also do competitive mathematics tutoring like AMC, Kangaroo, as well as other competitive courses for subjects like Chemistry and Physics. We teach almost all our classes online so region is not a problem, but language is. This is discussed further at the bottom.- We are looking for students ranging from grade 2 to grade 12, need to at least speak English well and if they can speak both Chinese and English, that is most ideal.- If you have these connections or have any ideas on how to establish them and find these parents, this job is for you.- We have a very high student retain-rate once the students try a class with us. The classes are not cheap but this is because our teachers come from prestigious universities, have been screened, and have years of experience teaching in their respective fields. If a particular teacher is failing to meet the expectations we have for him/her, they usually do not stay for long.- This is a job based off of commission rate, so there is no hourly wage or fixed pay. In any way you wish, as long as you find the proper parents and children who are interested and sign up for classes after one trial class, you will receive 5% commission from all classes bought by these parents onwards.- To get a rough idea of numbers, one hour is around 100-150USD and parents will pay for at least 10-15 hours upfront. So that is 50-112USD from one student after they successfully enroll in one of our classes. And remember, almost all our students will be retained, so you will get the next sum of money sent your way when they re-enroll, as long as they were recommended by you.- Just looking to find a few trustworthy and effective marketers in the short-term. However, if you prove yourself useful and competent, a longer-term deal/contract can be negotiated.- Looking for marketers in the Chinese, Malaysian, HK, and Singaporean markets mainly. But anyone with connections with Chinese speaking clientele/parents with children who speak both Chinese and English is preferred.Posted On: February 17, 2024 18:12 UTCCategory: Email MarketingSkills:English, Communications, Marketing StrategySkills: English, Communications, Marketing StrategyCountry: China\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered need, have, valuable-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Каждое уведомление проверяется в БД, там ещё ничего нет(и запись в mysql не мгновенная), и отправляется исходящее уведомление, получается что тоже 2-3 раза. как сделать, чтобы проверка существования уведомления была точнее? т.е. если пришло уведомление, быстрее чем сейчас запомнить его ID и другие серверы бы не отправили исходящие уведомления повторно для такого ID?наверняка есть какой-то стандартный способ решения...например, проверить в бд, подождать 1 сек и ещё раз проверить.или запустить условный redis и там все ID сохранять для быстрой проверки.или ещё какой вариант.желательно вариант требующий меньше работы по подключению.хостинг на aws, может там что-то готовое есть.Hourly Range: $25.00-$50.00Posted On: February 18, 2024 13:36 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:Web Application, MySQL, Amazon Web ServicesSkills: Web Application, MySQL, Amazon Web ServicesCountry: Slovakia\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered mysql, mysql, redis-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

You’ll be paid accordingly to how many products you are able to post.I have a bunch of products that are not on Amazon’s catalog yet.If they are potentially listed on Amazon, I will specifically ask you to search for it first & if you don't find it, then start a new listing.I need new product listings created with requesting approval to sell each one of the brands. Sometimes after getting the approval for one brand, several listings can be created.Step 1: Find ItCheck if there’s a listing for my product on Amazon USA already and add me to the listing.-You will be provided with one or more of the following to help you locate the items:--A list of either the search phrases to type on a designated website (which is the distributors SKU # on a website where the products were initially sourced from. The SKU takes you directly to their sold out listing that I have in stock & on hand.)Once you’re on the listing page, you will see the product images description, title, and at that point I would love it if it was as easy as just providing me with the link for the same exact product listing that’s on Amazon’s website that matches the color, brand, style, size and everything else about the product that I have on hand. But realistically speaking- you won’t get that lucky for all of my items, and neither will I.Step #2: Get me ungatedTherefore, if I’m not already approved to list the brand, then I’ll provide you with MY photos of the same exact product so you can help me get ungated to list the brand. If I am missing any images, you need to let me know in batches of 5-10 products at a time or at the end of your shift.Step 3: create a new product listing on AmazonThen you’re more than welcome to just copy and paste the titles and descriptions, that you see on the manufactures/ distributors website that I provided you to create my product listings for me for all of the products that are of the same brand.Step 4: Skip products requiring invoicesif any products are going to require receipts from within the past 180 days, you just have to skip those products because I’m only applying for selling products that require the images of the product to get approved for the brand not the ones that are going to ask me for invoices or receipts.ConclusionSo basically- I technically don’t care for any changes or customizations to my listings and you were going to do a lot of copy and paste when you actually have to create the listings. So it should be easy for the most part .I do have a lot of products, which is the only thing that makes it a time consuming project, but I’m paying per item, so I guess that part is nothing more than beneficial for you.Questions:(Failure to message me without answering the 5 questions I have listed below disqualifies your application immediately! More project details along with pay plan details will become available upon you responding to my questions. There is NO TRAINING that will be available for this project. Don't apply if you don't have experience.)communicate via Facebook.Upwork may be used for receiving and making payments but that's about it.To be specific:- I don’t want you to source or hunt anything.- I want you to list my inventory on Amazon.- Most of my branded products that are NOT my brand have never been posted on Amazon’s platform before (or have never been on Amazon USA before..).

We'll be using Webflow as our main landing page site and eCommerce website.We already have most of the designs, images and placements down for the new site, we just need someone to create the dynamic page templates for us based on the designs we have (pretty straightforward stuff really).Are you up for this? We could try with one sales page first.It would be something like what I attached for the course sales page template. And I assume using those dynamic CMS we could make one page and just have it be very dynamic across all the course sales pages, lead magnet pages, testimonials, etc.We want nice animations too, and of course optimized for phone, web, etc.If we like your page template, we could consider transferring the whole website to Webflow with your help!Posted On: February 18, 2024 02:55 UTCCategory: Web DesignSkills:Web Development, Web Design, Webflow, Landing PageSkills: Web Development, Web Design, Webflow, Landing PageCountry: Norway\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hey, online, education-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
