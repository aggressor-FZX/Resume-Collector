Suppose the demand curve of Eastern faculty children (CFCs) for slots in other universities is given by P = 30 − 5Q0, where P is the tuition price charged by other universities (in thousands of dollars) and Q0 is the number of CFCs who attend those universities. Eastern is now considering a proposal to subsidize some proportion k of the tuition charged to CFCs who attend other universities. Suppose Eastern knows that it can fill all its available slots with non-CFCs who pay tuition at the rate of $50,000/yr.

It's through a system called Mumara and uses Contabo in some way to help with this...I don't know much of the technical side of it.Here is what was done:Milestone 1 - Domain Configuration.Buying the domain names and configuring the DNS. You will need to buy the 5 domains (1 for the main application, 4 for the sending servers) and either give me access to the DNS control panel, or I will create a Cloudflare account that you will point the domains to so I can configure them.I will configure the domain names with all the necessary records (DKIM, DMARC, SFP, and others) and prepare them for connecting to the servers.Milestone 2: - Main server configuration, Email Platform Install and Configuration. AI Server setup.Prepare and configure the Main server for integration with the sending infrastructure, install the EMS (Email marketing software), and prepare the server for SMTP connection with the sending servers.Install and configure the AI algorithms.In this step, you will need to buy the main VPS and the AI Core VPS.In this step, you'll need to get the main server and the email software license ($27 per month).Milestone 3: - Sending infrastructure servers set up and configuration, AI algorithms integration.Configure the 4 sending SMTP servers, tie them into a complete sending infrastructure, configure the AI algorithms for the infrastructure inbox management make all the necessary configurations for a 10/10 anti-spam reputation. In this step, you will need to buy the VPSs that will be configured for sendingMilestone 4: Connect the sending servers to the main application and configure the sending infrastructure with the platform.Integrate the sending servers with the EMS, create and configure the SMTP accounts inside the software, create the bounce accounts, and make all the necessary adjustments inside the software.Milestone 5:Ip and Domain warm-up, reputation establishment. I will do all the necessary procedures to have a 100% inbox rate for our email servers and sending domains.While the servers are being established there will be a system tutoring course where I will teach you everything you need to successfully master the system.After the completion of the project, you will have my 30 days of guidance on the safe usage of the system and supportWE NEED HELP WITH THIS ASAP!

I would like to host this survey on my website, which is built on WIX.I would like a brief introduction text before the overall survey and before each section. Each individual section would be on a different page (i.e. not all 40 questions will be visible in one go), and each page to have a back and next button.All questions would be compulsory and the respondent would not be able to move to the next page/section without answering all the questions in the specific page.I will be happy to consider and explore creative suggestions around the survey construct.At the end of the survey, a separate section will capture the respondent details, NAME, email ID, Title, Organization Name, Organization Website, Size of the Organization, Industry, and Geography. The Size, Industry, and Geography fields will have a predefined drop-down list, while other fields will be free text. Free Text fields would need to have some mechanism (if possible) to check that no random content is entered.Once the respondent has completed the survey, two things need to happen.1. Summary and Section-wise Score to be generated for the completed survey AND emailed to the respondent in a pre defined template comprising ---- Overall Score, Standard text for each of the 11 sections, specific score for the individual 11 sections, a standard pre-defined text (5 possibilities) based on the overall score, and a standard text asking the respondent to get in touch to discuss the scores along with a link to schedule a meeting2. The individual responses to individual questions and demographic details from each completed survey are to be shifted to a meta-database on a pre-defined Google Drive as individual records, which can be extracted into a .csv or .xls format.It's difficult to predict at this stage the number of respondents, but I would like to plan for the solution to be capable of flexible and scalable.If this effort requires any separate hardware or software license, those costs would be borne by me.Lastly, the quoted budget is indicative.

This game is a visual novel adult parody of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians universe.What I would need made is fully rendered stylized background images that fit into the game. Some of these backgrounds will also need minions(or characters and props placed on separate layers).I have attached several examples of the style of background. I am looking for someone that can perfectly replicate that art style. I have also attached some of the character art for the game. The \"minions\" in the backgrounds would need to match the character designs that have already been created just in different poses and at a slightly lower level of detail.Finally, I attached an example psd of how the background layers work and how the minions fit into the artwork!This first Job Posting would be for the Big House Office at Camp Half-Blood.

The specific platforms and the types of data we are interested in are as follows:1. Semrush (via Provided Account)- Utilization of the built-in connector is preferred; however, if not viable, the creation of a custom connector will be necessary.- Data Points: Organic and Paid Traffic Analytics, SEO Ranking Analytics, and Backlinks Analytics.2. Google PageSpeed Insights- Focus on Main Category Scores and the top 3 recommended actions/errors for Core Web Vitals, SEO, Speed, and Best Practices.3. Google My Business- Status (claimed/unclaimed), completeness of data, reviews, and review rating.4. Instagram Historical Public Data (like notjustanalytics.com)- Metrics: Followers, Engagement, Average Comments, Average Likes, Top 3 Performing Posts, Reels Analytics (play rate).5. TikTok Public Data- Metrics: Followers and Engagement.6. LinkedIn & Pinterest- Visual representation showing presence (existing or non-existing).Implementation Options:The successful contractor can choose from two approaches based on efficiency, reliability, and ease of maintenance:- **Option A:** Utilize Google Sheets and Google Apps Script to pull data from the respective APIs into individual Google Sheets for each client and then configure Looker Studio to source data from these sheets.- **Option B:** Directly build custom connectors for each required API to integrate with Looker Studio.Project Deliverables:1. Development and implementation of all required connectors, ensuring accurate and reliable data retrieval.2. Creation of a comprehensive dashboard in Looker Studio that dynamically updates to display the specified metrics from each platform.3. Detailed documentation on the architecture, configuration, and maintenance of the developed system.4.

Context: General tech role"},{"role":"user","content":"Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Hi,I am seeking a ChatGPT or just about any LLM specialist to craft AI-generated articles on a list of keywords that I give you. I currently have a list of about 32 keywords that I am trying to target and I need you to use your preferred tool of choice to write a [REDACTED_PHONE] word entry for each of them. You need to instruct your tool of choice to write the articles in a way that mentions the target keyword as much as possible without compromising on the readability of the article.At the beginning and end of the article, it should also mention the company name that provides the service the article is about and link to its site. All in all, it's a very straightforward process, just automating the writing of content marketing articles. I was doing it myself but it's getting too cumbersome submitting several prompts to ChatGPT 4.0 for each article (as it can't write [REDACTED_PHONE] word articles in one-go, you have to break them into separate sections and them combine them afterwards).Please also make sure that the articles aren't written too generically. You want part of your prompt engineering to include the act of instructing it to write in a more human manner that will relate to the readers, otherwise it'll just end up writing the articles in a way that is now easily detectable as AI-generated content by most people.I've found that finding content relevant to the keyword online and copy-and-pasting/feeding it the information from those articles makes it so it doesn't give you the most generic information imaginable. You just tell it to then re-write it in a fashion that sounds more human and it will do a relatively good job of that. Then just have it insert the company in one of the paragraphs in the introduction and conclusion. The introduction needs to be subtle and relevant, I do not want the articles coming off as too \"salesy\".I am looking to pay $3 per finished article and will have probably another couple hundred keywords that I'll need to target in the near future. Assuming you can churn out a finished article every 10-15 minutes like I was doing, this job will be paying about $12-$18 an hour. Send your proposals my way if you are interested.Budget: $100Posted On: February 18, 2024 20:02 UTCCategory: Creative WritingSkills:Content Writing, Search Engine Optimization, Article Writing, English, Article, Blog Content, Writing, Blog Writing, SEO WritingSkills: Content Writing, Search Engine Optimization, Article Writing, English, Article, Blog Content, Writing, Blog Writing, SEO WritingCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered seeking, chatgpt, just-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Four years ago, my co-founder and I launched a video licensing business with the vision of expanding its presence across the US. However, shortly after our venture began, my co-founder returned to Poland, leaving the business's future uncertain.Despite my efforts to propose a fair buyout of my 50% stake in the company, the negotiations have reached a stalemate due to unrealistic counteroffers and a lack of alignment with the current market conditions. Our initial goal was to resolve this matter amicably. Unfortunately, the discussions have veered off course, with proposals that fail to reflect the seriousness of the situation.I require a legal professional who can delineate clear boundaries and articulate a range of scenarios to my co-founder. These scenarios should include, but not be limited to, a potential lawsuit for actions detrimental to the company. The ideal candidate will possess strong negotiation skills, a thorough understanding of corporate law as it applies to Delaware C-Corporations, and experience in resolving co-founder disputes.Your role will involve strategizing the best course of action, ensuring that all legal avenues are explored to protect my interests and those of the business.

Context: General tech role"},{"role":"user","content":"Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Viasify is an AI powered appointment setting website.The purpose of this app is to schedule appointments automatically and then send google review requests to customers.To do this I need a couple of things.First we have the basic version of the app where:For SOLOPRENEURS.This version of the app is for people who work by themselves, like for a example a tattoo artist, a nail artist, a barber, etc... ONLY FOR 1 USER.It includes- A personalized chat bot- An integrated calendar inside of the app where users can see their occupancy rate and where they can block the hours they don't want to work.- Online reservation portal- Online payment portal- Automatic reminders to customers before their appointment so they can confirm- Reports- Services / products tab where they can add, delete or change services (prices, duration, etc) and products.- Client data base-- It will include an email marketing page where clients can create sequences and automate their email campaigns (like for example if a customer gets a haircut send a reminder in 1 - 2 weeks to comeback)- It has missed call text back, so if the business isn't available to answer a call and the call gets missed we will automatically send a text message to schedule and an appointment and continue the conversation over SMS1) I need the app to be able to connect to SMS, FB, IG, Web Chat (SMS Chat), Live Chat, GBP (Google Business Profile), as soon as a client pays and their profile is created they should be taken to a page where they can sign in to all of their accounts, if they have a website they should be asked to sign into their website so we can add a chat widget.2) After that first page, clients should go to a page where they list all of their services with their prices and how long they take to do, this will connect into a integrated calendar and a dashboard where they can see their occupancy rate and how much money they have generated.3) After that second page we should go into a third page where clients can \"train viasify\" by doing this [REDACTED_URL] basically clients can train Viasify through their website link or by doing questions and answers about the business.Here we also ask clients to add details about their business like: business name, location, number, etc... AND how they want the chat bot to respond, friendly, serious, funny, etc...4) After that third page clients should be redirected to a fourth page where they can test their chat bot and see if its working correctly, if they encounter any problems, like for example the chat bot doesnt know something they can go back to page number three and fix it.5) After checking that their chat bot is working correctly clients enter their client profile where they can see a unified chat page, in this page clients can check all the conversations that the bot is having in every platform. It will also have a email marketing tab, a report tab and a calendar tab.DONENow for the advanced version of this app.For ENTREPRENEURSThis version of the app is for business owners, like for example a tattoo studio, a nail salon, a barbershop, etc... This should be clear in the pricing page.It's basically the same as the basic version of the app but- It allows multiple users- It will include google review automation, 1 hour after every service clients will be asked to review the services and to provide a 5 star review through the same channel they scheduled the appointment- Auto reply to reviews, so the business will reply automatically saying thanks or asking for feedback to every review like this [REDACTED_URL] Access to the appThe client portal would look a lot different for the advanced version of the app, it would include an admin level and a staff level with different permissions.On the admin level they would be able to see all the features displayed on the basic version of the app but it will also include:- A page where they can add more staff like [REDACTED_URL] and give or take permissions, add a commission structure to their staff to see how much they need to get payed and select which staff can do each service- A page specifically to follow the google reviews they're getting and the answers the AI is giving- A page where you can create and sell gift cards, create promotions / discounts, etc...- Viasify app - To see everything in their phone.I would need a version of the website and app in English and Spanish.In both versions of the app the AI should be able to know when someone is booked and offer the next best time to schedule an appointment.Finally I need an affiliate portal, this can be for non users of the app as well as for users of the app, in this affiliate program we will share 30% of the profits generated on a recurring basis.I'm open to any ideas that you might have to make Viasify even better for business all around the globe.Posted On: February 14, 2024 08:48 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:AI Agent Development, AI App Development, AI Bot, Web Development, Web DesignSkills: AI Agent Development, AI App Development, AI Bot, Web Development, Web DesignCountry: Chile\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Automated Excel workflows using google, automation, dashboard to create dashboards and custom macros, improving reporting speed and reducing manual effort for clients.
