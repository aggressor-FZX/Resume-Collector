The power of the amplifier should be 50 watts.It is necessary to choose the simplest possible circuitry and radio components so that they are easily accessible. The circuitry should be simple because the amplifier will be used as a noise interference for testing and there are no special requirements for its parameters. You can choose the material and design at your discretion. Elements should be available in stores such as Mauser and Digi-Key .

Je to hlavná pointa celého projektu. Aby ľudia si pochopili čo to pre tých ľudí znamená byť X kultúrou, a na akých problémoch im záleží alebo na aké dávajú dôraz.Zohľadniť tento cieľ projektu v rámci textu by bolo vhodné.Naše združenie sa venuje rôznorodým kultúrnym aktivitám a podujatiam pre cudzincov na Slovensku. Podporujeme aj charitu a z každého podujatia prispievame na humanitárne fondy. Snažíme sa ukázať silu umenie ako prostriedku na boj proti násiliu. Že každý umelec alebo fanúšik umenia vie tým odkomunikovať svoju pozíciu, prispieť k interkulturnemu dialógu a predísť aj predsudkam.Sme organizácia mladých ľudí a naši podujatia majú väčšinou komunitný aspekt, bez zvýšenej oficialnosti, a komunikácia je hravá a snažíme rozprávať voľnejším jazykom ako ste správne napísali. Táto \"lekcia\" by mala mať charakter rozprávania divákovi o filme a o okolitých informáciách. Chceme stále aby ťa lekcia mala prínos pre človeka ktorého zaujíma film ale aj pre obyčajného diváka.

You can be trusted to carry out a list of core tasks flawlessly week after week with very minimal supervision.But you also have experience / interest in managing others. You enjoy checking in with team members, and helping drive projects along. You feel good about supervising core initiatives, and knowing that your effort and focus has helped bring them to life.We have a lot of admin work we need help with - but there are some projects and core initiatives we're pushing along too, and you would be involved in all of it. If this sounds interesting to you please shoot us a note! Some things to know:Important for the role:- This will be during US hours. The work is a lot of fun, but very demanding, and we wouldn't recommend applying if you're not committed to being available and at your best during this time window.- We're looking for someone with years of admin experience, some customer service experience, and potentially even team ledership experience. All three are not necessary together, but at least several years of admin experience is key: this means you've developed your own process for getting things done.- Attention to detail is really critical.

Aktuell arbeite ich zu viel im Business als am Business. Du wärst meine erste virtuelle Assistenz/Social Media Manager, das heißt das Aufgabengebiet wäre etwas breiter.Für den Start habe ich an vielleicht 4-5h/Woche gedacht mit der Option es kontinuierlich bis zu einer Vollzeitstelle auszubauen, je nachdem was für dich und mich passt. Auch dein Stundenlohn ist perspektivisch verhandelbar.Ich mache bereits Umsatz, d.h. die Finanzierung ist gesichert. Hauptberuflich führe ich seit mehreren Jahren ein großes Team von Analysten und Data Scientisten, d.h. ich bringe einiges an Führungserfahrung mit und bin es gewohnt mit hochqualifizierten Menschen zusammenzuarbeiten, die super selbstständig arbeiten. Zusätzlich bringe ich knapp 6 Jahre Erfahrung im Online-Umfeld mit. Du kannst dir also sicher sein, dass das, was ich hier mache, Hand und Fuß und eine Zukunft hat und nicht in zwei Monaten wieder verschwunden ist. Wenn du dir einen ersten Eindruck verschaffen möchtest: Meinen IG-Account findest du unter fabian__kress. Anfragen zur Zusammenarbeit werden allerdings ausschließlich über Upwork beantwortet.Super, super wichtig sind mir Deutschkenntnisse, insbesondere schriftlich, auf mindestens C1-Level. Zum einen spreche ich ausschließlich deutschsprachige Kunden an, zum anderen spreche ich zwar gutes Englisch, habe aber in der Vergangenheit gelernt, dass es doch deutlich einfacher ist Mitarbeiter in der eigenen Muttersprache zu führen. Ich brauche dafür kein Zertifikat, aber verfasse bitte deine Bewerbung auf Deutsch und erkläre mir, wo du Deutsch gelernt hast und welche Erfahrungen du mit der Sprache hast.In folgenden Aufgabengebieten benötige ich Unterstützung:- Erstellen, einstellen und posten von Social Media-Beiträgen auf Instagram. Später ggf. auch TikTok (Beiträge, Reels & Stories)- Erfassen von Statistiken und darauf basierend den Content optimieren- Erstellen/überarbeiten von ManyChat Flows- Erstellen von themenbezogenen wöchentlichen Newslettern- Pflege von Kursinhalten- Unterstützung bei der Erstellung von Kursinhalten (z.B. Schneiden von Videos, erstellen von Audiodateien, ggf. auch Präsentationsfolien)- Recherche- Unterstützung beim Aufbau einer WebseiteSieh die Liste oben als eine Übersicht über die Aufgaben, die ich abgeben könnte. Was davon du am Ende übernehmen würdest, hängt natürlich auch an deinen Vorkenntnissen und wie gut du dich insgesamt machst. Ich bin durchaus bereit dir das ein oder andere beizubringen, möchte allerdings auch nicht bei Null anfangen. Solltest du komplett neu in den Themengebieten sein, sieh also bitte von einer Bewerbung ab.Im Laufe der Zeit können auch weitere Aufgaben dazukommen. Das können wir dann gemeinsam schauen.Wahrscheinlich macht es Sinn ein wöchentliches Meeting zu haben und sich ansonsten via Chat und Sprachnachrichten auszutauschen.Folgende Eigenschaften sind mir besonders wichtig:- Qualität- Zuverlässigkeit- Strukturiertheit- Selbstständiges Arbeiten- Lösungsorientiertes Denken- Professionalität- Nice to have: deine Zeitzone ist halbwegs in der Nähe der deutschen Zeitzone. Ich möchte ungern mitten in der Nacht aufstehen, um mit dir ein Meeting zu haben.Ich würde unsere Zusammenarbeit gerne mit einer kurzen (bezahlten) Probezeit starten und danach können wir gemeinsam schauen, ob es passt.Ich freue mich darauf dich kennenzulernen!Liebe GrüßeFabianHourly Range: $5.00-$11.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 19:14 UTCCategory: Social Media MarketingSkills:Social Media Marketing, Instagram, ManyChat, ActiveCampaign, Newsletter, Social Media Management, GermanSkills: Social Media Marketing, Instagram, ManyChat, ActiveCampaign, Newsletter, Social Media Management, GermanCountry: Germany\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

I'm reaching out with an exciting proposal that I believe aligns perfectly with the vision and ethos of your platform. I'd like to discuss the creation of a new YouTube channel called \"VoiceUrStory,\" dedicated to amplifying the voices of women from all walks of life through engaging interviews.The aim of \"VoiceUrStory\" is to provide a platform for women to share their diverse experiences, insights, and expertise. By showcasing the stories of women from various backgrounds, professions, and perspectives, we aim to inspire, empower, and educate audiences worldwide.Here's a brief overview of what the channel could offer:1. Interviews: Regular interviews featuring women leaders, entrepreneurs, activists, artists, professionals, and everyday heroes. These interviews will delve into their personal journeys, challenges faced, successes achieved, and lessons learned.2. Diversity of Perspectives: \"VoiceUrStory\" will prioritize inclusivity and diversity, ensuring that women from different ethnicities, cultures, ages, abilities, and identities are represented and heard.3. Empowerment and Inspiration: Through authentic storytelling, the channel will empower women to embrace their voices, pursue their passions, and overcome obstacles. Viewers will be inspired to strive for their goals and effect positive change in their lives and communities.4. Community Engagement: We envision \"VoiceUrStory\" as more than just a YouTube channel—it's a vibrant community where viewers can connect, engage in dialogue, and support one another.5.
