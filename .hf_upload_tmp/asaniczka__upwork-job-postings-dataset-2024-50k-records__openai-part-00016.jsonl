You are not developing the complete game, just the setting up, specific snapshots, and display of the game. You are required to write a 'level' editor for a simple game called MysteryWorld. A level in MysteryWorld is a room made up from 10 x 10 grid. Each cell in the room is referred to by the row and column number (coordinate).Game Specifications• A room in MysteryWorld can be populated by two types of entities: inanimate and animate entities.• There are two kinds of inanimate entities: stones which are represented by 'S' and holes which are represented by an 'O'. Holes also have a depth in meters represented by a number between 0 and 20. Expectedly, inanimate do not move.• Each living entity has a measure of its health, represented using an integer value between 0 and 100 and all the living entities can move. There are three types of living entities: dragons represented by the symbol #, human beings represented by @; and monsters represented by a ' * ‘ character. Each human being has a name, the monsters have strength represented by a number between 0 and 5.• All the animate objects can move and their health is usually reduced when they move.• Animate entities wandering around the worldo Humans: The humans always move to the cell to on their right, provided that this cell is not occupied and that they are not at the edge of the room. Otherwise they move to unoccupied randomly chosen cell adjacent to their current position. Their health is reduced by one every time that they move.o A dragon moves to a cell that is randomly chosen from those cells that are unoccupied, and adjacent to its current position. The health of the dragon is very volatile and is reduced by a random number between 0 and 5 every time it moves.o Monsters: A monster moves as many cells as its strength at any direction (up, down, left or right) as long as the destination is free and the monster remains within the room. For instance, the monster in position (9,3) in with strength 5 can move to position (9,8) but it cannot move to (4,3) because the cell is occupied, the monster cannot move to any other cell because it will reach the end of the room. In the case that there are not possible movements, the monster will move to a random empty cell next to it. The health is reduced as many points as the strength. In the unlikely event that all the possible options are invalid, the entity will not move. Furthermore, the default movement of all the living entities is to a random adjacent cell. You will work only with the console application to test your implementation. Code needs to have at least 3 classes: 1. Entity class: This is an abstract class which will act as the parent (base) class to all the different entities (Holes, Stones, Humans…) of the game.2. Room class: This is the class that stores the positions of all the entities. It should ideally contain the Methods to add entities, display the room, display information etc.3. Main class: This is the main class that handles the game. The menu will be implemented here and you will need to add the call to the specific actions.Functional Requirements1) The program should be a console application. The user interacts with the program by typing instructions into the standard input, and the program gives output by writing to the standard output.When the program starts, it should display the initial state of the game, and a menu. The initial state of the game should contain 2 holes, 2 stones, 3 monsters, 3 humans, 2 dragons, placed randomly in the room, with the constraint that two entities cannot occupy the same position. In the initial state, the depth of the holes is a random number between 0 and 20, monsters will be allocated a random strength between 0 and 5 and the three humans will be: Harold, David and Clare. All the animate entities are 100% healthy.2) The initial menu should offer the following options:1. Display Room2. Move all the animated entities3. Display the entity state by coordinates4. Reset the room5. Finish3) If the user selects ‘1’ from the menu, the state of the game should be displayed as shown in Figure 14) If the user selects ‘2’ from the menu, all the living entities should be moved according to the rules specified earlier.5) If the user selects ‘3’ from the menu, they should be prompted to specify a row, and a column, and then the properties of the entity at that position (if there is one) should be displayed, the output might be as follows:Entity properties:Type: humanName: HaroldHealth: 47If there is no entity in that cell, then your program should output a suitable message.6) If the user selects ‘4’ from the menu, then the state of the board should be reinitialised, in the manner described in functional requirements.7) If the user selects ‘5’ from the menu, then the program should terminate.Budget: $50Posted On: February 19, 2024 12:44 UTCCategory: Video Game DevelopmentSkills:C++Skills: C++Country: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered you, need, develop-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

We have 4 microsites and 1 “corporate” site that need your TLC. Then I want you to “hold my hand” as my team implements your prioritized suggestions – reviewing and directing our work. We may need different SEO services in the future, but this workflow (your audit + we implement your recommendations + your review) is how I’d like to start.What We Need• An initial SEO audit of a single microsite. A quick written summary would probably be helpful, but the meat of the matter will be in Zoom discussions between you and me.• At least bi-monthly phone consultations to review SEO priorities, align on strategy, and ensure we're focusing on impactful actions.• Expertise in programmatic SEO, as it's one of our main marketing channels. Our microsites are built with Sinatra or Jekyll with Shopify as the checkout, so familiarity with SEO on these platforms is a plus.• Advisement on SEO best practices within the context of evolving AI technologies and how we can lay the groundwork for future developments.What You Bring to the Table• Proven experience with SEO, particularly with programmatic SEO and understanding the nuances of ranking microsites.• Ability to communicate complex SEO concepts in layman's terms and provide actionable insights.• A strategic mind that can help us prioritize SEO efforts effectively, considering our limited resources.• Availability for at least two 1 hour phone calls a month to discuss and refine SEO strategies.Our End GoalWe want to build a long-term working relationship similar to the successful one we have with our PPC expert—collaborative, insightful, and profitable.Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to working with you.Posted On: February 22, 2024 21:40 UTCCategory: SEOSkills:Search Engine Optimization, SEO AuditSkills: Search Engine Optimization, SEO Audit\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered quick, introi, the-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Our philosophy challenges the illusion of a perfect life achieved through maximization or exhaustive effort. Instead, Zwischensinn finds fulfillment in embracing life as it is, even in its complexities and challenges, and discovering significance in the present rather than chasing after an elusive, perfect future.We need a brand designer to create a logo, color palette, and visual style that embodies this ethos. The design should be timeless and elegant, steering clear of trends for a classic look that resonates on a deeper level. It should communicate sophistication, adaptability, and a clear connection to our mission of finding purpose in life's journey. However, it mustn't be esoteric at all. We're looking for a cool and relevant brand that can change lives. Yes there is a belief behind - it has its foundation in a purpose driven life by the Christian belief in the message of freedom through Jesus Christ who has died for our sins and raised to provide eternal life. But in the end this Christian belief is only the foundation and is not necessarily seen in the brand itself. This identity should not just represent our brand but also inspire those who encounter it to reflect on the significance of the present moment in their own lives.Key Design Elements:- Logo: A symbol that captures the essence of Zwischensinn—finding purpose and beauty in the moment, threading life's meaningful path.- Color Universe: A palette that reflects depth, thoughtfulness, and serenity, supporting our philosophy with colors that are both classic and expressive.- Visual Identity: Clean, minimalist designs that convey our message with clarity and elegance across all mediums.This is the website in German [REDACTED_URL] On: February 19, 2024 16:55 UTCCategory: Logo DesignSkills:Minimalist, Signature Logo, Logo DesignSkills: Minimalist, Signature Logo, Logo Design\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered design, brief, for-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I had wanted to be able to open the client financial model in Excel and then using Get Data, easily populate the latest version of their financials instead of having to login and export everything via QuickBooks.4. The issue is the reports QuickBooks sends are in .xls format. When you go to fetch them wirth Power Query, all values populate as 0. In order for Power Query to read the file, it must first be converted to XLSX.5. It looks like a third party tool called Cloudmersive may help do this. Here is a YouTube video, but some people have had challenges. Also, this shows to CSV instead of XLSX. This tool may also be an option and perhaps this blog post will help.6.

We're not interested in spoon-feeding our artist every single trait we want in the collection. You should be well-versed and be able to come up with your own traits in the collection and ensure the traits mesh well together across the whole collection.The color scheme is simple, it will be black and white mostly but with small subtle hints of color (mostly for the eyes).

Context: General tech role"},{"role":"user","content":"Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"I am a solo entrepreneur with experience managing software projects. I want to create a cross-platform iOS and Android alarm app with a special method of disabling the alarm: facial expression recognition. The alarm functions would be very simple, similar to the built-in alarm functions of each mobile OS clock app. But instead of a button to turn off the alarm, the user will be prompted to make a specific facial expression. The alarm will only disable when the front-facing camera detects the specified facial expression, for example a smile, or a frown.This alarm app is similar to a reference application that no longer works on modern devices. You can see a description and example images here: [REDACTED_URL] here:[REDACTED_URL] that this previous app is only used for reference. The concept of using face recognition to disable an alarm is not patented, copyrighted, or trademarked, and no infringement of intellectual property is intended or allowed in the development of this app.I believe that both iOS and Android include local, on-device facial recognition libraries that should be able to perform the required face recognition and identify simple expressions such as \"frown\", \"smile\", etc. A full list of expressions for detection will be provided, but it should be no more than 5-6 total.The final additional capability of the app would be to capture an image of the user making the expression that disables the alarm each time it activates. The image would be saved to the user's Images or Downloads folder with a Caption showing the facial expression the user was prompted to make for that alarm activation instance. When the image is captured it is shown to the user and a Share function is available within the app to immediately share the captured image to the OS-provided share destinations, e.g. social media apps, etc.An outline of the desired features is shown in bullet points attached here as an image, along with some example images of the app linked to above for reference.Please note: if development is significantly easier and/or cheaper on one platform or the other, iOS or Android, and much harder or more expensive cross-platform, I will consider focusing only on the easier platform for an initial application. But I would prefer cross-platform. I am an Android user so that would be most easy for me to test, but I have access to Mac devoices for testing in a dev environment (I do not have an iOS device at this time).There are additional features to implement in future versions of the app, so a successful developer will have potential future work as well.

We will help you operate your store, if you don't have a store, for the successful creation of it, there will be a payment as specified in the offer. For each sale that we together make, you will have a 1-dollar commission. And we welcome Etsy stores owner to work together as well.1. Why do we need you to be our partner?Etsy is a good platform that sells handicrafts. However, this platform does not allow sellers from some certain countries. So we are looking for a cooperative partnership who can register the store and we will work together. We want to sell exclusively elegant handicrafts to customers worldwide with you, and Etsy is one of our channels.2. Why don't we use VPN?We tried, and none of the stores survived(they are all suspended permanently ), which means this is not workable. We tried to work with other people's IDs and bank cards from other countries and it worked.3.What will you do?Once you create the store, we will help you set up your store. For more details plz don't hesitate to contact us4. Why would we provide such a seemingly high share with you, since this is just an store partner work?It's really hard to register an Etsy store AND maintain it from suspension. So we have to build long-term cooperation with you.5. Will there be any effects on your side?Yes, you cannot register any Etsy shop for yourself in the future, so take this into consideration.6. What do we require from you?In previous interviews with some freelancers, some candidates were irresponsive after I sent all documents necessary for the registration. So please consider carefully and be responsive before applying for this job.7.People find some articles that say, we would indeed share with you the profit but we never ship the items and the customer would ask refunds that will be deducted from your card, is this true?Definitely not. First of all the email linked to the store, or the store itself clearly shows the status of the items, so you will know that we are truly selling products. And even customers request for refunds, the money will be refunded from the turnover to be confirmed to transact to your card.Here's a special note for U.S candidates:For taxing concerns, if you work with us, in the beginning of next year, you will receive a 1099-k tax form, which considers you as a shop owner. When you file taxes, you will file business expenses which is our total sales amount minus your commission, and we will issue an invoice to prove the business expenses, so there will be no problem with taxing.Again, to save everyone's time, consider this offer carefully, do all the research you can, make your decision, and then submit the proposal if you are comfortable with it.

I am very experienced with the human side of these cases -- the strategy, negotiations, planning and preparation for court hearings and trial. However, I need more help with the many financial documents that I receive from the opposing parties, including bank statements, tax returns, receipts and spreadsheets. In the past, I used freelancers through a temp agency, and they were good people. One person spotted falsified bank statements: we had obtained set of bank statements directly from a bank, and another set from the husband directly. The freelancer noticed that the husband had changed his copies of some statements to hide payments to a girlfriend. Actually used cutting-and-pasting, and recopying pages. When statements were compared, they were different! This was VERY helpful in court. I also need help in noticing any tax returns that are hiding income, or trying to hide or minimize assets and income. I need an honest, trustworthy reliable person to work on these cases. They should understand basic tax law, with some tax-return experience. I see personal and small-business documents -- no large corporations.

The product can be viewed on Facebook at [REDACTED_URL] (Client-Side):Web Interface:Create a user-friendly web interface where consumers can design their labels.Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the interface.Consider using a front-end framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for a more structured approach.Image Editing:Integrate an image editing library or tool to allow users to customize their labels. You could use libraries like Fabric.js, Konva.js, or an HTML5 canvas for this purpose.Image Upload:Implement a feature to allow users to upload their designed images.Utilize HTML \"input type=\"file\"\" or more advanced libraries like Dropzone.js for file uploads.Back-end (Server-Side):Server-Side Language:Choose a server-side language such as Node.js, Python (Django or Flask), Ruby on Rails, or Java.Image Handling:Implement server-side code to handle and process the uploaded images. Resize or format the images as needed for printing.Storage:Set up a storage solution (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) to store the uploaded images securely.Database:Use a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store information about the uploaded images, associated orders, and user details.Authentication and Authorization:Implement user authentication and authorization to secure the application.Integration:APIs:Create APIs to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end. Use RESTful or GraphQL APIs for data exchange.Communication with Label Manufacturing Companies:Establish a system for communicating with the label manufacturing companies. This could involve integrating with their APIs or setting up a data transfer process.Order Processing:Develop a mechanism to process user orders, including sending the design specifications and image files to the label manufacturing companies.Security:SSL/TLS:Implement SSL/TLS for secure data transfer between the client and server.Data Validation and Sanitization:Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).User Authentication and Authorization:Ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access and modify their data.Remember, the specific implementation details and technologies may vary based on your project requirements and the label manufacturing companies' systems.
