Context: General tech role"},{"role":"user","content":"Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"OverviewWe have a software tool that compares two text documents, referred to as the \"left\" document and the \"right\" document. These documents can be in PDF, DOC, or DOCX format. The tool lets users analyze differences and decide whether to accept or reject these changes. After reviewing, users can create a new DOCX file that includes the accepted edits and marks the undecided changes with special tags (like 'w:ins' for added text or 'w:del' for deleted text). This new document starts as a copy of the right document, but it will use text from the left document where changes were not accepted. Any changes not decided upon will appear as open edits in Microsoft Word.What We NeedWe want to make a new tool or script that can take a list of changes (in a file called changeList.json) from our comparison tool and apply those changes correctly in a new third DOCX document, based on what users have accepted or rejected. To keep things straightforward, we will only provide DOCX files for comparison.The changeList.json file records all differences spotted by our tool. Differences include:Match: Text is the same in both documents.Insert: New text appears in the second document.Delete: Text from the first document is missing in the second.Replace: Text from the first document is changed in the second.Here’s an example of what the change list might contain:[\"kind\": \"match\",\"text\": \"Documento\"// ... more info here,\"kind\": \"replace\",\"leftText\": \"S\",\"rightText\": \"s\",\"status\": \"pending\"// ... more info here// ... more changes listed]Consider any change not marked with status as pendingWhen applying a 'replace' action in the DOCX, it should be formatted like this:[w:del] ... [w:t]S[/w:t] ... [/w:del][w:ins] ... [w:t]s[/w:t] ... [/w:ins]If a user rejects a change, the original text (leftText) takes the place of the changed text (rightText) in the new document. If a change involves deleting text, that text should go back where it was originally, with the same style and format.The ChallengeThe main difficulty lies in transferring these changes into the third document when they involve tables. It's especially hard with tables that have removed rows and columns, or when cells are joined together or there are tables within tables. We'll provide example documents that include these tricky situations to help you understand what needs to be done.There are no strict rules about which technologies you must use, but our system works on Linux containers and we use Python. Your new tool or script must work within this environment. It should be able to run on Linux containers and be callable from Python code.Posted On: February 16, 2024 20:45 UTCCategory: Back-End DevelopmentSkills:Back-End Development, Python Script, REST API, Document Formatting, Python, Document Analysis, Document Automation, Document Management System, APISkills: Back-End Development, Python Script, REST API, Document Formatting, Python, Document Analysis, Document Automation, Document Management System, APICountry: Brazil\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered python, automation, api, json-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.
