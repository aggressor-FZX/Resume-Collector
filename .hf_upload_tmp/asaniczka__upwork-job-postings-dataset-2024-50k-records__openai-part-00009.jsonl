I need a google sheet with the following columns for the top 200 travel destinations worldwide:city namegoogle_place_idlat long (place)lat long (where you would actually want to stay in the heart of downtown)radius in meters (for lat long downtown)short descriptionThe important thing about this (and what I cannot automate) is that I need a circle that best represents where a business traveler might stay when visiting a city. For instance, if you look for New York, NY on a map using this: [REDACTED_URL] The pin will drop in downtown Manhattan and a large radius of hotels would include places like New Jersey and Brooklyn... which is not New York. It would also exclude midtown below central park, which is where many people stay. If I am, say, searching for hotels in that area, business travelers generally do not want to be across a river. They want to be in the heart of where they are traveling.For this project, I need someone to get the \"business district\" center as a lat/long and the radius for a circle that encapsulates 100% of that district... and that circle should be as small and as tight as possible. This should be represented in the google sheet.For some places, this will be very easy and straightforward (like Atlanta, GA). For others (like New York, NY, or Tokyo Japan), you're going to have to be creative and use your judgement as if you were booking business travel for some CEOs and Board members.For now, this is a one-time project but I can see this project expanding to the top 2000 cities in the world, and it will be need to be continuously updated. In the future, we will build sophisticated bounding boxes and polygons that better represent where business travelers might want to travel, but for now, a center point and radius is where we will start.Some images are attached to show you what I mean around searching for New York vs where one might want to stay.Posted On: February 23, 2024 14:26 UTCCategory: Data EntrySkills:Google Sheets, Google Maps, Travel PlanningSkills: Google Sheets, Google Maps, Travel PlanningCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered google sheets, google-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.

When there is a surplus, it should increase the quantity of the final product produced by updating the production yield without affecting the quantities of materials used.*Add a button next to the loss button.Main Requirements:- Enable us to input the possibility of quantities exceeding 100% in production, meaning if we aim for 100 units and use 100% of the material, it turns out we manage to produce 105, allowing these 5 extra to be entered.-We need to apply an adjustment to our module in order to take control of the surplus. Currently, our system allows us to calculate a shrinkage of finished products. This means that while the material is consumed 100%, it does not manage to produce 100% of the final product due to defects or waste; instead, it only produces 80%. This allows us to close the production process and for the system to accept these differences. We need to apply this in reverse, that is, to use 100% of the raw material but in this case, to produce more than 100% of the finished product.-We can use the same shrinkage workflow, simply reversing it, so to speak. The button should appear as \"Surplus\" alongside the shrinkage button.Current Scenario: We use a combination of manual and automated tracking to measure production levels.Expected Improvements: We expect important upgrades in our tracking process. The key improvement sought is real-time updating of production levels, offering live updates to manage surpluses effectively at any given moment.Ideal skill set for this project:- Experience with software development odoo 11- Expertise in automated tracking solutions- Good understanding of production management systems in odoo 11- Experience with real-time data integration.Regards,Team Softechies SolutionsBudget: $70Posted On: February 19, 2024 22:51 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:Odoo, Odoo Development, Customer Relationship Management, Python, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, MySQL, PostgreSQLSkills: Odoo, Odoo Development, Customer Relationship Management, Python, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, MySQL, PostgreSQLCountry: Pakistan\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Automated Excel workflows using python, pivot to create dashboards and custom macros, improving reporting speed and reducing manual effort for clients.

I have examples of the data I want to use as the source and a few examples of how that data can be presented. I'm looking for someone to take what. I have turned it into a formula-based dashboard that I can then use for all different projects with different data, that all source from the same locations, and will present the data in the same visual manner. Essentially this boils down to what we call a \"prospect report\" for commercial real estate leads. I source the leads from several [platforms, can export that data into a spreadsheet, and then i use that data to create a visually appealing easy-to-digest presentation for clients. In a perfect world, I would just copy and paste the data sourced from each location into this template once for each property/ for each report, and it will take that initial data input and automate/streamline the workflow process to get a visually striking presentation presenting that data. This involves a template for a spreadsheet to enter data that populates into visual dashboard that can then also populate onto a presentation. we want a template for that presentation as well, that would be easy to swap out pictures, and source of data etc...one example attached- the habit tracker - is not the example i want to be referenced for this project creation- but i included it because it shows an example of data being sourced from a spreadsheet and translated into a visual representation automatically, that can then be easily incorporated into a pdf presentation. the other documents are the exact examples of the process im looking to streamline with templates. I created a wide range of price per hour here because im looking to have a fixed budget for this, and some people may be able to do this in one hour and charge a high price and others may be able to do it over a longer period of time, and some people may already have a template like this that they can rip off and duplicate from so i figured budgets would vary greatly. I may be willing to pay more to someone who can deliver an absolutely perfect end product- but is more expensive, or there could be someone who delivers the basic necessities inexpensively - that may work for me initially as well- i want to see both ends of the spectrum.Hourly Range: $3.00-$100.00Posted On: February 13, 2024 23:54 UTCCategory: Data VisualizationSkills:Dashboard, Presentations, Data Visualization, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Graphic Design, Presentation Design, Template DesignSkills: Dashboard, Presentations, Data Visualization, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Graphic Design, Presentation Design, Template Design\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Automated Excel workflows using excel, dashboard to create dashboards and custom macros, improving reporting speed and reducing manual effort for clients.

Specifically, to create a new user journey and design for volunteer projects, where participants would receive an instant confirmation upon registering and have the ability to invite friends to join.**Background & About Time Auction**[Time Auction]([REDACTED_URL] is a charity that advocates volunteerism. We encourage volunteering with inspiring experiences, while connecting skilled-volunteers with NGOs. Our platform matches individuals who want to volunteer their talent with nonprofits that need those skills. Since 2014, over 230,000 volunteer hours have been contributed by the Time Auction community.Currently, NGOs can post skilled volunteer projects, where volunteers can apply and fill in details such as a self-introduction and LinkedIn profile. NGOs will receive the applications and select suitable candidates to reach out for an interview. Due to the popularity of some of these projects, only about 25% of project applications successfully receive an offer from the NGO to conduct the project, resulting in disappointment for the majority of volunteers who did not receive an offer.**We would like to add a new function to the project posting process, with an objective to further utilize the matching platform by lowering the barriers to application and speeding up the process.** For certain projects that NGOs do not need to interview the candidates (such as helpers to sell flags on Flag Day), volunteers can register and instantly receive a confirmation with instructions on how to join (e.g., meet at MTR at 10 am on the day).

I want to give someone a steady and stable role in my operation.I run a media \"business\". It's really just me. I have hired a few freelancers in the past but this will be my first time expanding to something more consistent.I have a background as a professional in video production. I know After Effects and Premiere very well. I am good but not great at photoshop. And absolute shite at illustrator and indesign. Please type 'agora' at the beginning of your reply so I know you read instructions. For the past few months I have been tasked with running a client's entire social media and marketing, and this includes a lot of still designs.I will need you to be available, probably for 10-15 hours a week, to take on extra workload. What that workload will consist of will depend on your skill set: I could use everything, illustration, typography, vector, raster, motion design, etc. Some of the projects we will be collaborating on: you will finish my designs, or sometimes you will build the base and I will finish the design. This is going to be a collaborative role. I need someone who above all is RELIABLE. I'm a dumb artsy fartsy type that struggles in the corporate world. So I gotta have someone here who is ready to work and just get it done. I value high quality work but I also know how long it takes and how much care it takes. It's above the pay grade here. I need someone to plug and play. That's it. And if you show you can do that I'll give you other opportunities and more humanizing gigs.I have subscription to Envato Elements, Artlist, and Motion Array. As well as Sound Strip and a few other stock services. So you will have access to all of those libraries.I really like retro pastels and paper textures and pop art. The client you will be servicing has a whole line of ads that are pictures of him turned into illustration (posterize, and blend colors) that looks like a comic.

I have two meta descriptions showing on every page of my new blog.

I also have specific ones for each page, so I believe this is where the issue is coming from. I of course deleted the meta description from the section which makes it so it's added to all pages, which should have removed it but it did not.

A tongue-in-cheek, sober look at all the ways in which humans think that ultimately make them miserable and how eerily similar they are to the progressive attitudes that prove so attractive to the next generation of young people.This is a crash course in critical thinking that focuses on the modern 'woke phenomenon' and how it may be doing us all far more harm than good.I am looking for a handful of independent beta testers to read the book and summarise their feedback in writing. Fact checking and a strong understanding of the source material is a plus. *This is not a politically correct book - I want to politely flag this before anyone expresses their interest.*The book explores many of the missteps that have led us to where we are today, including pop psychology fads like the self-esteem movement as well as the monolith that is the self-help industry. From there, I look to the rise of victimhood culture and the many cognitive distortions this encourages before engaging in a deep dive into the politics that underpin modern thinking that many of us are unaware of.The book is just over 200 pages in a 6x9 standard-size book.My ultimate aim is to publish a book that crosses the boundary between sophisticated psychology books (that target a smaller, niche audience), with a modern day, easier read that appeals widely (think Mark Manson + more references and psychological rigour).Many thanks,SimonBudget: $65Posted On: February 14, 2024 07:59 UTCCategory: ProofreadingSkills:Grammar & Syntax Review, Fact-Checking, Proofreading, Review, Style Guide, Writing, Content Writing, Creative Writing, EnglishSkills: Grammar & Syntax Review, Fact-Checking, Proofreading, Review, Style Guide, Writing, Content Writing, Creative Writing, EnglishLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United Kingdom may apply.Country: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered beta, readers, required-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Are you trying to be an influencer, or are you focused on editing for influencers?Turn-around times needed:First draft 2-3 daysSecond/Other drafts: 1 day per draftCommunication:Editor can respond to email or messages within an hour or two to ensure prompt communication.Typical Raw Footage2-5 GB70-120 files (most files are only 5-20 seconds long)20-50 minutes of footage cut down to a 10-20 minute video.Budget: 45-$50 (once the editor has demonstrated similar proficiency as our top editors they can be moved from $45 to $50,Every video is different...some may be a little more footage than average and some may be a little less. The editor will quickly get a good feel for the workload.Higher Paying ProjectsSome videos may be larger than typical either because of additional footage or significantly more intensive editing requirements. We will specify the higher budget beforehand if we feel that the video qualifies for a higher budget.Video types:vlogs, challenges, travel, experiences, birthdays, sports, music, etc.Technical Specs:Dropbox: We use Dropbox to share and transfer files and rendered video projects. You will need a Dropbox subscription that allows for more than 2 GB.Music Library (we provide this)Tips for Songs: change music every minute or two, or as needed to tell a story, match a style/scene. The video should almost always have music. The only time we don't want a music track is if there is good reason such as when we are playing an instrument or singing.Intro/Outro: we provide the intro. and the editor makes a short outro (typically 10 seconds)Channel Bug: we have a few but the editor normally creates one for the video.Video Quality: we film in 1920 x 1080 at 60 frames per second so please render in the same quality. The overall data/bit rate should be around 24,000-25,000. If you are choosing the highest quality within 1080HD then it should be fine. Choose 60p (not 60i) if you have the choice.Audio Tips:Make sure the music is not overpowering our voices.Don't mute things too often. We want to hear the sounds of the family and the sounds of nature. The talking & interactions keep it down-to-earth and real.Voiceovers can be used in a variety of situations (like when we are showing our vlogging faces for too long).Pacing:First Minute = Best MinuteThe first minute or the vlog should be the best minute. YouTube is extremely competitive, and viewers will quickly click away if the content is not exciting. Storytelling, graphics, great music, fast pacing are essential but most critical in the first few minutes.Teasers:Short teasers are sometimes used to give the viewer a quick glance of upcoming dramatic or exciting parts of a video.The best way to get to know our style is to watch some of our videos! We can send you examples of our different types of videos and you can also find them by browsing through our playlists.Let me know why I should consider you for a phone interview.

After the project is completed and I am satisfied with the end result, I will be happy to save your profile and do more work with you in the future. I need this project completed by 25th February maximum.The site is on WordPress being built with Elementor. Two pages and a header, the homepage, the form page and the header. I have already built the about us page and half completed the header which I need you to finish off. The design for both desktop and mobile pages is all done, it just needs to be built. There is also an interesting functionality that I need done which I'll explain further below.If you need to download free plugins, you may do so. If you need a paid plugin to continue work, please consult me before purchase and I will look into it. As of now, you will have access to the three plugins:- Elementor- Essential Addons for Elementor- Premium Addons for ElementorLogins for the site will be given upon hire.The site is for Muslims that are looking for local mosques that do Taraweeh (a type of prayer during Ramadan) all across Australia. They hop on and view/filter through a variety of variables. Additionally, there is a form that mosque owners can fill out to have their mosque be apart of the website database.Now for this project, I need the form to be built and automated in a way where once filled out, the admin of the website receives an email and can either check the submission on his email and on WordPress to make sure the information is accurate and then has the option to select either \"Approve\" or \"Reject\". If rejected, the submission does not go through and is deleted. However, if the admin clicks \"Approve\" then the information submitted should automatically be inputted in the table and shown as an option on the homepage. We do not want to manually enter all results into the table as we receive hundreds of submissions, it has to be automatic. You do not have to input all the mosque details on the home page design. Just 3 of them after the functionality is built to make sure everything is working correctly.Now for specific notes in regards to the form page. For the 'address' field, I need it to be linked where it automatically gives results based on what the user types and the user is forced to select their address from the results shown. In order to prevent users mistyping or providing an incorrect address.For the 'Isha'a/Taraweeh Time' field. I want that to be a dropdown with times between 6pm-10pm in increments of 15min (e.g 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, etc).For the 'Number of Taraweeh prayer units' field. I also want that as a dropdown with the options: 8, 11, 20, 8 + Witr, 11 + Witr, 20+Witr.For the 'Best places to park?' field, I just want to remind that it is to be shown underneath the address on the homepage table as per the design image.Just reminding one more time, I need this project done by 25th February max. Any further questions, we can discuss later. Thank you for your time and looking forward to working with you.Budget: $250Posted On: February 14, 2024 06:16 UTCCategory: CMS DevelopmentSkills:WordPress, Elementor, CSS, JavaScript, Web Development, PHP, HTML, WordPress DevelopmentSkills: WordPress, Elementor, CSS, JavaScript, Web Development, PHP, HTML, WordPress DevelopmentCountry: Australia\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hello, hope, you-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.

Problem:Datasmith completely ignores materials with embedded configurations that are unsupported. It fails to export the material asset and does not log the existence of the material in the scene.2. Solution:Create a custom plugin based on the existing Datasmith functionalities, but with enhanced capability to directly access material settings, especially those related to V-Ray. Upon completion, this plugin should address the above limitations.3. Expected Outcome:- Client Side:The plugin will access material settings in a scene, log the list of materials along with all their bitmaps, geometry mapping, and shader nodes. It will output a modified version of the Datasmith files, including all material data, and produce a process log.- Server Side:During import sessions, the modified Datasmith files will guide the import engine in reconstructing a version of the materials based on the import log. This reconstructed material will be a hybrid of existing templates, categorized by material type (e.g., metallic, caustic, SSS, etc.), with additional modifying nodes to closely resemble the original material inputs.Familiarity is needed with the following skills/programs:3ds MaxVisual StudioC/C++Unreal EngineDatasmithRelevant documentation:1) Datasmith SDK: [REDACTED_URL] When you download the Datasmith SDK as instructed by the documentation, there are many code examples you can familiarize yourself with and build upon.

No blurry or pixelated images.Artist: Evil WizardSong: BoogeymanThis is a work for hire agreement. You are agreeing to sign over full copyright ownership upon full payment.RequirementsThe album artwork will be in the style of a black and white Rorschach test.The artist name, song title, and the icon logo need to be easily visible.Evil Wizard text should be the font from the logo. Boogeyman can be the same or a different font, whatever may look better. I imagine both somewhat adapting and blending to fit the look of a Rorschach test but this is open to whatever works.The circular logo does not need to be to the left of Evil Wizard. So the circular logo could be in the middle with Evil Wizard across the top and Boogeyman at the bottom or any other layout that looks good.The CreativeStarting with the static image:It needs to look like a Rorschach test. Symmetrical overall, but doesn’t have to be exact. Definitely needs to look psychedelic.Include some form of a “Boogeyman.” I’m leaning towards a more classic man shaped appearance of a Boogeyman. I thought about doing a one eyed monster with the icon logo as the eye. Or maybe the Boogeyman can have one eye. This is fairly open so there’s some creative room. I don’t want it to look cartoony (cartoon eyeball is to reference the idea, not the style). It should look creepy and realistic.I attached an example of an AI design with the keywords psychedelic Rorschach test boogeyman. I’m not looking to use this, but there are aspects of it that are nice. I like the way the top corners look and something similar might work as a border all the way around.I could’ve slapped some text and the logo on top of the example and called it a day. But I’m looking to take it to another level. So this is a custom professional job for an artist. I won’t accept something just a little better than what I could do. I say this to ward off anyone that just wants to slap something together for a quick buck. Please put the codeword Rorschach at the top of your reply so I know you’re the type of person that reads the entire brief.AnimationWe’re limited to Apple’s specs: [REDACTED_URL] I imagine the animation morphing back and forth between the main static image and a classic Rorschach test. And not just a simple fade between two static images but a true morph from one to the other as if the ink is expanding and contracting, spreading on the page like ink would, and forming one image from the other.Even if this level of detail is not possible with the Apple art specs I still might consider this for another use. If it had to be simplified for Apple that should be ok.Budget$500 - $1000This is a rough estimate. I’d like to see a rough draft of the static image before selecting anyone, but I will consider anyone if your portfolio displays the skill level and you’re confident you can do this. If you feel you can, but the budget isn’t right, let me know.Please provide an estimate for:Price for static image of album art.Price for animated iTunes artwork version.Price for more detailed animation if iTunes specs won’t allow it.I have AI, EPS, & PNG files of the logo if needed.Thank you for your consideration,DaveBudget: $750Posted On: February 23, 2024 02:51 UTCCategory: IllustrationSkills:Illustration, Graphic Design, Character Design, AnimationSkills: Illustration, Graphic Design, Character Design, AnimationCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hello, this, project-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
