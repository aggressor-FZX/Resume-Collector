The effectiveness of your work will be measured by the quantity of Calendly appointments and the subsequent sales discussions they lead to. A detailed SEO strategy and an audit will be required every quarter.Additionally, the role may expand to include managing YouTube SEO and other areas, for which we will offer additional remuneration. This position is intended for a long-term partnership. Your task will include analyzing competitors such as Slide Bean, Magic VA, and Joorney, and coming up with 10 strategic approaches. For example, we're looking for articles like 'Get Uber Pitch Deck Template' to boost downloads and email subscriptions, and we need 10 more ideas like this.A thorough keyword research and competitive analysis are also part of the expectations. Our aim is to reach 4,000 website visits within the first 3 months, escalating to 16,000 in the following 3 months, with the progress being tracked through Calendly. You will be responsible for managing a website on either Wix or WordPress, including creating lead magnets, content, backlinks, and overall site supervision.To ensure we meet our targets, the bulk of the work, including page optimization and strategy implementation, is expected to be completed in the first 3 months. This initial phase is crucial for reaching our early sales target of 8. After achieving this, you will have an additional 3 months to work towards a sales target of 32, following which the next 6 months will be focused on cost recovery and less intensive work.We plan to engage you in extensive work on page strategies, backlinks, and both on-page and off-page SEO, requiring a commitment of at least 9 months to balance the costs. Terminating the contract within the first 3 months would be detrimental to your financial interests.Regarding website traffic and sales conversion: With 1,000 website visits and a projected 1% call rate, this would typically result in 10 calls. Assuming a 10% sales conversion rate for services priced between $2000-$4000 USD, this would likely yield 1 sale. To summarize, 1,000 visits at a 1% call rate gives 10 calls, and 10 calls with a 10% sales conversion rate equals 1 sale.Budget: $6,000Posted On: February 18, 2024 00:50 UTCCategory: SEOSkills:SEO Backlinking, Search Engine Optimization, SEO Keyword ResearchSkills: SEO Backlinking, Search Engine Optimization, SEO Keyword ResearchCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered are, need, seo-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I have a detailed plot summary and a rough chapter by chapter outline for a dark romance fantasy novel I'm working on. I need someone super creative to help me comprehensively fill in what happens each chapter. There are 33 chapters and I expect about four to five sentences per chapter to be filled in. This I estimate to be about 3000 words total. You don't have to fill it in like a story, I just need the ideas on paper. Can be bullet points, doesn't have to be pretty.I need someone potentially willing to go weird with it and to not be offended by demons and the devil as redeeming characters.Please provide an estimate in your cover letter, along with plot outline examples (fantasy or paranormal preferred). I will reach out if I think we may be a good fit and provide more details about the book.Please, no AI. I work with AI often enough that I recognize the ideas it gives and the wording used.

I want to show how it is really like to be human, containing all the beautiful things about being human, just as the dark and tragic ones. I'm being very explicit, not hiding any facets, thus I need a mangaka who is very resilient mentally!The story itself is going to be about a young man, who has essentially given up on his life already, standing on the verge of committing suicide, just to find out that he is the chosen one who is supposed to save humanity. On the journey to do so, he'll constantly be faced with how brutal reality is and what cruel things human beings are capable of, being forced into an internal struggle. He was not particularly fond of human beings at the start of his journey in the first place and throughout the story he'll be wondering more and more, if it's the right thing to save humanity or should he rather work along with those who're trying to eradicate it? Already shouldering this heavy burden, he falls in love with a young woman who accompanies him on his journey, who turns out to be an advanced AI robot, just as he starts to see an example in her for how pure human beings can be, further spilling oil into his ongoing questions about if it actually needs human beings. The antagonist of the story is a young woman, the CEO of a giant tech company which is a leading force in AI and cybernetic technology. This company works together with various governments in the world, kidnapping citizens and exchanging them with Ai robots which are 1 to 1 copies of said individuals, so no one even notices that their loved ones are going missing. The overarching plan here is, to exchange all the meaningless individuals in the world with those robots, because those robots obey no matter what, they don't have any needs, so they never become unhappy and they don't waste as many resources as a human being would. A truly perfect world for any narcissistic psychopathic elite who sees lower class citizens as mere peasants.So if this sounds like a project you want to indulge in make sure to reach out and we'll talk about everything else! :)Posted On: February 16, 2024 13:56 UTCCategory: Cartoons & ComicsSkills:Manga, DrawingSkills: Manga, DrawingCountry: Germany\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered heya, looking, for-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

The EA will execute trades based on spread between specified instruments profit/loss and after opening the trades, we need comprehensive trade control. EA will pick the price of given instruments from our given time and date and will assume trades are open from that time and date and will calculate the profit or loss of each instrument in USD ( Or Currency ) and will initiate the trades when spread between these different instrument, s equity will reach at specific level.Key Features:1. Spread Table Visualization: The EA will display a spread table on the chart, comprising 6 lines for different instruments or assets. Each line will consist of 10 boxes for essential details such as symbol, virtual lot size, direction, price, equity, and lot size for trade entry. Please refer to the attached sample picture for visualization.2. Trade Initiation Based on Spread: Trades will be automatically initiated when the spread between designated instruments reaches a specified value.EA will check The pair when spread will reach at our given level. EA will keep the maximum loss side pair direction in same as we set in the table while will change the direction of lower loss or profit side instrument for trade initiate. The EA will calculate and monitor spread differentials as per user-defined parameters.3. Equity-Based Trade Direction: Upon trade initiation, the EA will analyze the equity of involved instruments and determine the optimal trade direction. It will maintain the instrument with lower equity in the current direction and potentially reverse the direction of the other instrument for optimal risk management.4. Control Panel Features: The EA will include a comprehensive control panel with the following functionalities:• Display of starting date and time, with options for auto-update and with given distance.• Presentation of today's starting balance and equity.• Setting of equity and balance cutoff values for closing trades.• Configuration of email alerts for trade notifications.• Customizable trade headings for easy identification in email.• Trailing with 3 extra step. At first level, only jump to break even, Second jump to given profit target, from third trailing till exit with given distance.• Background settings for configuring spread parameters, trade initiation levels, and trade control options.5. Special Considerations and Requirements:• Ensure persistent settings across MT4/MT5 restarts, changes in date/time, timeframe, or instrument.• Address issues related to price freezing, requote, and excessive trading activity, with appropriate error handling mechanisms.• Configure email alerts to trigger only for executed trades, minimizing unnecessary notifications.• Implement safeguards against account closure due to hyperactivity, including the ability to deactivate the EA under certain conditions.• Ensure compliance with market trading hours and margin requirements, preventing trades during closed markets or insufficient margin situations.• Provide unique identification for trades initiated by the EA for precise management actions such as closure, reversal, or trailing.Next Steps: Please review the attached detailed proposal for a comprehensive understanding of the project requirements. We value your expertise and look forward to collaborating with you to bring this EA to life. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the project, please don't hesitate to reach out.Posted On: February 18, 2024 11:13 UTCCategory: Desktop Software DevelopmentSkills:MetaTrader 4, MQL 5, MQL 4, Forex TradingSkills: MetaTrader 4, MQL 5, MQL 4, Forex TradingCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered dear, developer, are-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Considering the project's requirements, a WordPress solution with custom forms and functionality might be initially considered; however, a more tailored web application using frameworks such as React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, coupled with a database solution like MongoDB or PostgreSQL, might offer the flexibility and scalability needed for such a project.Responsive Design: The webapp must be optimized for tablets, given the primary usage scenario on food trucks.PDF Generation and Management: Integration of a robust PDF generation library to handle the creation and management of reports.Security: Implementation of best practices in web security to protect sensitive data and user information.Deliverables:A fully functional inventory and task management webapp tailored to the needs of food truck operations.Source code and documentation for the developed solution.A guide on managing and updating the webapp.Potential Challenges:Ensuring real-time synchronization of data across multiple devices.Designing an intuitive UI/UX that can be easily operated in the fast-paced food truck environment.Seeking:A developer or team with experience in web application development, preferably with a portfolio that includes similar projects.Expertise in both frontend and backend development, as well as experience with database management.Strong communication skills and the ability to provide updates and insights throughout the development process.Budget and Timeline:Please provide a detailed proposal including your estimated budget and timeline for the project.Your must have read this scope in detail, and use keyword \"NonAI\" in the header of your application.

Right now, the site is overwhelming: information is all over the place, the user-interface looks messy. The result: A confusing user-experience.The project starts with (1) re-organizing the written content so that it drastically improves the user-experience, (2) a UI design overhaul to improve usability even more, and (3) a development overhaul using modern tech.You will be responsible for no. 1, the UX-redesign, in direct collaboration with a writer, and later, a UI designer. I will personally do no. 3.About you:- You’re a student/starter/career-switcher who’s learned the fundamentals of UX, but lacks hands-on experience;- You’re motivated to get into this career path;- You’ve got spare time to work on this project;- You understand how your role might relate to the role of a writer/editor.Your responsibilities:- Familiarize yourself with the organization, the target audience and the content;- Re-structure/re-organize the pages and their content so that they smoothly guide even a first-time visitor to their destination;- Work with a writer to lay out the written content in clearly defined web pages.- Work with a UI designer to make the UX wireframe to UI design a seamless conversion.What you’ll get:- Present this project as truly relevant work experience;- Show that you are capable of analysing and re-structuring large and complex content;- Experience in real teamwork through collaboration with cross-field colleagues;- Show that your work positively impacted users and thereby contributed to a real organization’s goals.--- Why a student/starter/career switcher ---I'm personally an aspiring developer who's looking to achieve the same thing as you: earning an income in the fields that we enjoy. I'm a career switcher and don't have a relevant degree…I'm at the stage where I just need more \"real\" experience to gain credibility.Which is why I'm looking to collaborate with others, so we bundle our strengths to end up with an amazing portfolio project. Plus:- Making this somewhat lonely journey more fun;- Gaining relevant work experience;- Gaining proven teamwork experience;- Be each other's \"professional\" references;- Do our best to get a testimonial from the organisation that we're doing this for (would be epic!);- Present the project on our resume/portfolio website in a way that highlights our strengths.Again - our goal isn’t to earn — it’s to learn and build a portfolio/resume and gain credibility! I personally want to get (far!) ahead of other starters and actually have a good shot (instead of applying 10s if not 100s of times without success). So if you want the same, definitely do apply! Thanks :)— Even more info about this initiative —Please know: this is just an initiative started by me, a poor self-taught developer (lol). Despite putting in countless of hours, I have made 0$ with it and my portfolio is pretty empty still...So it's only aimed at people like me, who want to get into their dream career, not for the more established people.All projects are \"made up\" by ourselves, but they 100% mimic real work (we spot real-life improvement opportunities for organizations).So they're NOT paid (ok, just the minimum Upwork fee) nor done in actual collaboration with the organizations we're doing it for.We're just beginners in the end. It's hard to convince companies that we can be of much value.But here's the thing: We surprise them by delivering really good work. And in return we can at least expect a nice testimonial (which is extremely valuable moving forward). At best, who knows? Job offers? Professional connections? Introductions to other companies?But honestly - those are just extra's. It's about us gaining experience, working with team members from different fields, and presenting a really strong case study on our portfolios.Posted On: February 20, 2024 12:24 UTCCategory: UX/UI DesignSkills:Design & Usability Research, Website Redesign, User Experience Strategy, UX Writing, User Experience DesignSkills: Design & Usability Research, Website Redesign, User Experience Strategy, UX Writing, User Experience DesignCountry: Netherlands\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered looking, for, aspiring-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

This dual approach eradicates the uncertainty and frustration often associated with urban parking. The system's backbone, IoT devices installed in vehicles, monitor adherence to parking schedules, safeguarding against misuse and ensuring a smooth operational flow.Sustainability at the Forefront: Our commitment to sustainability is twofold: reducing unnecessary vehicle emissions by minimizing the time drivers spend searching for parking, and promoting a more efficient use of urban spaces. This initiative directly supports the global drive towards greener cities, aligning with efforts to combat climate change and enhance urban air quality.Empowering Urban Communities: Beyond the technicalities, our mission is to foster more livable, breathable urban environments. By simplifying parking, we're not just solving a logistical problem; we're contributing to the broader vision of sustainable urban development. Our service is more than a convenience—it's a step towards a future where cities are defined by their livability, not their congestion.In crafting a smarter, greener future, our smart parking service stands as a beacon of innovation and sustainability.

We need to design our packaging for this organic, coconut based, cat litter.This product is organic all-natural cat litter from recycled coconuts. It is fully compostable, clean of any synthetic chemicals, odor reducing, and doesn't leave a mess. It's ultra light and can absorb up to 7 times its weight in water! Current cat litter section at retail is ugly and the artwork is for previous generations. I am looking for some NEW, SEXY, MODERN, that millennial buyers can look at and relate too. Think of brands like Apple, SKIMS, 818 Tequila, Seager Co., Liquid Death, etc....Our company name is Island Kitty Co. Catch phrase is being worked on, but will be something like, \"Your Cats Throne.\" It needs to be compelling, eye catching, different, funny and yet serious at the same time. Regal Fratty is perhaps a description that could be used. It needs to stands out, will catch attention on shelves, and something that will dramatically stand out compared to the rest of the products in the attached photo of current products in market.Our brand is our identity and we want to create a cult like following for an age old, but renewed product. Think of the use case of canned water. Many brands do it, but Liquid Death is a cult like company that is worth over a billion dollars. Technically, they did not invest anything but created a strong brand.I am hoping to make fast progress on this bag design and be mostly complete in coming 2 weeks. I am open to working with the right person but would like to do this on a flat rate to start. I am also going to attach a photo of our logo.

SPECIFICS DISCUSSED IN MEETING.If you are an entrepreneurial-minded freelancer, then you might be a fit for my new brand agency. Especially if you're tired of grinding away for low pay, dealing with clients, and want to design and develop. Long story short, I am standing up an agency focused on helping men build manly brands (think gyms, construction companies, management coaching, etc.) catering to veterans, go-getters, and those who want to take charge of their lives. Therefore, you need to be that same kind of individual with a passion for success regardless of your hurdles and difficulties.You must be proficient with WordPress, Squarespace, and Shopify, as that is what many of my clients use or desire to use. You must be able to build the websites, not simply design them; therefore, you must be a designer and developer. It would help if you had a generalized idea of branding, marketing, and so forth, as that will be useful in bringing the websites to life. You will NOT be expected to maintain the websites as we are a branding agency, and continual maintenance falls outside of our day-to-day purview at this time.This is a unique opportunity for the right person to stay a freelancer while teaming up with a business to build a steady stream of business for themselves via my agency. As it stands now, I take care of all client intake, issues, and relationships, which means you will interface with me and be required to design and build sites. While I am slowly gaining more and more work, you will be an independent contractor responsible for your schedule, taxes, and so on. However, that also means that you will be setting the rates and so forth.If this sounds like an opportunity, I want to see what you have. Include reviews, samples of your work, and a resume if you have one. If you seem like a good fit, I will be reaching out to schedule a video call; this will only be open for one freelancer now.Hourly Range: $30.00-$50.00Posted On: February 16, 2024 19:21 UTCCategory: Web DesignSkills:Squarespace, Web Design, Web Development, WordPress, ShopifySkills: Squarespace, Web Design, Web Development, WordPress, ShopifyLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered price, placeholder, specifics-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
