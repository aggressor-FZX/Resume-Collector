We're a small business in Houston and need bookkeeping help, particularly with tidying up our QuickBooks (QB) file to be ready to send to our CPA. I have done this myself every year since around 2010, but I am behind this year timewise for various reasons. Also, I am kind of annoyed at QB since it keeps crashing on me and has vastly increased in price.I'm open to discussing possibilities, but here is my ideal scenario.1. I would securely send you our QB file from TY2022 with our CPA's final adjustments.2. I would download the needed QB webconnect files (there are four -- two checking accounts, one savings account, and one credit card account) and send them to you securely.3. I would provide you with the classification rules I have used successfully for a number of years to tag the transactions. Of course, I would welcome your expertise.Basically, I just need to add all of 2023's transactions into QB and get a file sent securely to our CPA. Our business is fairly simple accounting wise, and every single debit or credit falls into 15 different categories or fewer.Thanks for reading this far!

This unique scrolling behavior should allow storytelling in a horizontal format as users scroll down, enhancing narrative engagement.Dynamic Background Transition Colors: Also inspired by SendPotion, we want to implement a feature where the background color dynamically transitions as the user scrolls, adding a visually engaging layer to our websites.Key Requirements:Must have proven experience with Duda CMS and the ability to create custom widgets or integrate these features seamlessly.The implemented features should maintain compatibility with all existing Duda widgets, ensuring we can continue to customize each page (e.g., changing colors, adding buttons).The project should be executed in a manner that allows easy replication across multiple sites within our Duda account.Project Scope:Task 1: Implement Snap Scroll FeatureTask 2: Develop Horizontal Scroll FunctionalityTask 3: Create Dynamic Background Transition ColorsBudget and Timeline:We are offering $200 per task, totaling $600 for the complete project.We prioritize a swift execution and are open to the project being completed as early as today.Offer:We will provide access to our Duda account for development purposes.Potential for ongoing collaboration for future projects and enhancements.Budget: $600Posted On: February 20, 2024 21:36 UTCCategory: Front-End DevelopmentSkills:CSS, JavaScript, HTML, HTML5, CSS 3, Web Design, Animation, Web DevelopmentSkills: CSS, JavaScript, HTML, HTML5, CSS 3, Web Design, Animation, Web DevelopmentLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered description, our, dynamic-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Context: General tech role"},{"role":"user","content":"Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"OverviewWe have a software tool that compares two text documents, referred to as the \"left\" document and the \"right\" document. These documents can be in PDF, DOC, or DOCX format. The tool lets users analyze differences and decide whether to accept or reject these changes. After reviewing, users can create a new DOCX file that includes the accepted edits and marks the undecided changes with special tags (like 'w:ins' for added text or 'w:del' for deleted text). This new document starts as a copy of the right document, but it will use text from the left document where changes were not accepted. Any changes not decided upon will appear as open edits in Microsoft Word.What We NeedWe want to make a new tool or script that can take a list of changes (in a file called changeList.json) from our comparison tool and apply those changes correctly in a new third DOCX document, based on what users have accepted or rejected. To keep things straightforward, we will only provide DOCX files for comparison.The changeList.json file records all differences spotted by our tool. Differences include:Match: Text is the same in both documents.Insert: New text appears in the second document.Delete: Text from the first document is missing in the second.Replace: Text from the first document is changed in the second.Here’s an example of what the change list might contain:[\"kind\": \"match\",\"text\": \"Documento\"// ... more info here,\"kind\": \"replace\",\"leftText\": \"S\",\"rightText\": \"s\",\"status\": \"pending\"// ... more info here// ... more changes listed]Consider any change not marked with status as pendingWhen applying a 'replace' action in the DOCX, it should be formatted like this:[w:del] ... [w:t]S[/w:t] ... [/w:del][w:ins] ... [w:t]s[/w:t] ... [/w:ins]If a user rejects a change, the original text (leftText) takes the place of the changed text (rightText) in the new document. If a change involves deleting text, that text should go back where it was originally, with the same style and format.The ChallengeThe main difficulty lies in transferring these changes into the third document when they involve tables. It's especially hard with tables that have removed rows and columns, or when cells are joined together or there are tables within tables. We'll provide example documents that include these tricky situations to help you understand what needs to be done.There are no strict rules about which technologies you must use, but our system works on Linux containers and we use Python. Your new tool or script must work within this environment. It should be able to run on Linux containers and be callable from Python code.Hourly Range: $80.00-$120.00Posted On: February 16, 2024 21:39 UTCCategory: Back-End DevelopmentSkills:Back-End Development, Python Script, REST API, Document Formatting, Python, Document Analysis, Document Automation, Document Management System, APISkills: Back-End Development, Python Script, REST API, Document Formatting, Python, Document Analysis, Document Automation, Document Management System, APICountry: Brazil\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered python, automation, api, json-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.

It is about 120 pages.The narrator/ author is Mirth who acts as a alter ego for the author David Goodemote.Mirth is best known as an immediate, involuntary emotional response to a joke, sarcasm, or witticism. Even though spontaneity has been a hallmark of Mirth for centuries, Mirth is much more – he is the embodiment of devil-may-care, not concerned with the consequences of ignoring accepted conventional thought and behavior.Where medicine is involved, whenever Mirth has been needed, he has been by David’s side.While Mirth’s intervention has helped David through the potential difficulties of facing tough medical problems, it undoubtedly also contributed to a lack of caution to the point of fostering feelings of near invincibility on David’s part.Mirth did such a good job of patterning David’s health life to be not unlike that exhibited by Dorian Gray, that David often transported himself to a state of timeless disregard for his well-being.Cheerfulness is a habit, while Mirth is an unannounced flash of amusement. While David can enjoy the former, he cherishes the latter. That is why Mirth was selected as his mentor very early in his life.When David meets a new medical practitioner, the usual comment by that person is something like, “Reading your chart, I didn’t expect you to look so good.” David’s response is, “My chart seems like I should be taking my last breath, doesn’t it?”Mirth has written this book based on his own observations and the counsel he provided to David over time. David also provided his own uncompromising views for consideration by Mirth for possible content.I need someone who has produced an audiobook for Audible including voice, editing, and successful submission. You will need to use your own studio. A PDF of the book is attached.Hourly Range: $22.00-$50.00Posted On: February 19, 2024 23:40 UTCCategory: Voice TalentSkills:Female, Voice-Over, English, Middle-Aged Adult, AudiobookSkills: Female, Voice-Over, English, Middle-Aged Adult, AudiobookLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered audiobook, mirth, the-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

We have around 200 data sets each consisting of 49 numbers or values.From each column or each data set, 7 Process numbers are chosen, and our goal is tobuild a machine learning model that predicts these 7 Process numbers for the nextcolumns/dataset.Problem Statement:-------------------The challenge lies in understanding the underlying relationships within the 49 numbers ineach data set, which influence the formation of the 7 pattern numbers of the data set.The relationship or criteria is not definable and explainable. We have to learn bybackpropagation or reverse learning based on the interpretation of the prediction resultsavailable as of now.While our machine learning model has shown promising predictive capabilities, we aim tostrengthen the prediction capabilities by learning the process or calculations or the rulesbased on which the modes are presently giving out correct predictions of 4 to 5 correctnumbers in a prediction of 9 numbers from 49 numbers.For example, in the data set 394. In the test sheet 394-1, with 0.2 test size the SVMLinear classifier model has given out a prediction of 57, 140, 2, 136, 66, 51, 7, 48 and107. Among these 9 numbers, 57, 136, 66 and 7 are correct pattern numbers for the dataset 394.Similarly, in the data set 395, test sheet 394-1A with a test size of 0.2, the Random ForestClassifier model has given out a prediction result of 116, 48, 180, 104, 121, 22, 42, 1 and106. Out of these 9 numbers, 180, 104, 121 and 42 are correct pattern numbers of dataset 395.Next, in the data set 396, the test sheet 396-1 with 0.5 test size the SVM linear classifiermodel has given out a prediction result of 144, 26, 36, 125, 71, 112, 83, 5 and 62. Amongthese nine numbers, 144,112,83,5 and 62 are the correct pattern numbers of the data set396.These models and interpretations are coded by an amateur programmer who is still astudent. I want expert programmers like you to see every aspect of the model and theinterpretation and suggest how I can solve my problem and reach my target. My target isto be able to correctly predict at least 6 numbers correctly among 9 numbers of predictionoutput.Posted On: February 16, 2024 03:28 UTCCategory: Machine LearningSkills:R, Machine Learning, Data Science, Neural Network, Natural Language Processing, StatisticsSkills: R, Machine Learning, Data Science, Neural Network, Natural Language Processing, StatisticsCountry: Canada\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered overview, our, project-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I completed the products but the variations are not presented in an attractive way in the store. Presently it is rather confusing for users which should be corrected ot make the shop and especially the product selection easy to navigate.2) Upload of photo and text by userAll users must be able to upload a photo and a name to personalize the product. Besides this there is an additional possibility to personalize the product which requires the user to give three to six short combinations of a very short text (one to two words) and a short text (one to four words).This functionality has to be integrated into the order process.If you are interested in working on this please let me know and I will send you the URL of my store and some additional important information.Greetings,JosefBudget: $150Posted On: February 13, 2024 11:12 UTCCategory: Ecommerce Website DevelopmentSkills:Shopify, Shopify Templates, Ecommerce Website Development, Shopify ThemeSkills: Shopify, Shopify Templates, Ecommerce Website Development, Shopify ThemeCountry: Germany\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered have, set, new-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
