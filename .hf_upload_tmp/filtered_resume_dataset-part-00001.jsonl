For example, I should be able to enable or disable the RSI, OBV, and EMA conditions individually based on my preference. This flexibility will allow me to customize the indicator according to different market conditions and trading strategies.Adjustable Parameters:• It’s essential that the parameters for each condition are adjustable within the indicator’s settings. For instance, I should be able to specify the RSI range for oversold and overbought conditions (e.g., RSI ranging from 30 to 40 for oversold), as well as adjust other parameters such as the length of the EMA period or the sensitivity of the divergence detection.Examples of Adjustable RSI Ranges:• In particular, for the RSI condition, it would be beneficial to specify ranges such as 30-40 for oversold and 60-70 for overbought, allowing for more precise customization of trading signals based on RSI levels.Posted On: February 14, 2024 04:01 UTCCategory: Scripting & AutomationSkills:Pine Script, PythonSkills: Pine Script, PythonCountry: Australia\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

I teach music classes to little kids and have an up and running website that I made using squarespace and jotform. My website is www.saddleriversong.com. I need the following:1) I need class lists generated automatically, by class. I currently use the submissions tab in jotform, but I don't find it easy to use since it mixes classes. I'd like to move class lists to a third party platform.2) I need to cap the number of kids in each class by location. Some locations are capped to 12 kids, some are capped at 18 kids.3) I need a waitlist button added wherein parents do not need to pay at the bottom of the page. Right now, the payment part is required, and I can't figure out a way to override this if a class is waitlisted.4) I need to integrate an option for families to purchase a discounted classpack of 8 via a stripe link (already created), wherein they are able to select classes and apply their classpack on the jotform page.5) I am open to using a different platform if this isn't doable on jotform, but I'd really prefer to stick with it if possible.6) I need a way to email the parents in each class (not by location, by specific class at that location) quickly and easily.I need this all done this week.Thank you!CarlyHourly Range: $15.00-$30.00Posted On: February 20, 2024 03:24 UTCCategory: Web DesignSkills:Jotform, Web Design, Web DevelopmentSkills: Jotform, Web Design, Web DevelopmentCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

My grandmother made it for me every week when I was a child. We would walk to my neighbor's house to take a banana from her banana tree. The best time to pick the bananas was in the spring, when the bananas are ripe. They make the best banana pudding.\"Then the output should look like this:Frequency, Keyword;3, banana(s);2, banana pudding;1, banana tree;1, favorite food;1, grandmother;1, ripe;The prompt I'm using works well at first, but soon after it begins miscalculating the number of keywords that appear in a text. If there is a keyword that appears once, it will show that keyword four times, for example.I'm also open to using other tools for this that might handle this better than ChatGPT.Please help me fix it!

Qualifying the c-g is up to the user.National Company – these take more of an interest in you and do provide some service, but they are national and do not know the area, and you will never speak to the same person twice.Local Agency – these provide highly personal service and do the work for you.

High level of service and just as affordable as the other options.Things to be aware of when looking for a c-gCertification and experience – some providers have neitherBackground checks – the c-g have access to your home so must be trustyReliability – no shows and late arrivals are common, agencies give you a point of contact when this happensYou may want to cover the variety of care available. 24/7 care for a bedridden person is different than 3-4 hours a couple of times a week just to provide some extra help.Key Termshow to find a c-ghow to get home health care for parentshow to find a c-g for elderlyhow to hire a c-ghow to find a live in c-gIf you find this article is a little short then you can add a section based on this key word “caregiver interview questions”.

We have the CAD for all the shells (that go around the outside of the device) but not yet for the material folding covers.We've got about 5 new product styles, each have approximately 10 images each that we need creating to show the back/front/inside/standing positions, etc.Each of those 10 sets of images will ultimately be needed in approximately 5-10 colours. (We will have 5-10 colour variations per product type).This is the 1st time we'll be attempting rendered images, and the reason we haven't in the past is that the materials haven't looked real enough. We want them to look like photographs, essentially. With the same photography style we use today on our images.It's super important the materials and textures are right, and the lighting.I think Adobe Substance 3D for this is the right tool, so we can use actual photos of the lining materials to ensure that the materials look 100%.There are 4 parts to each image:1) the shell/bumper which we have in CAD already2) the internal lining3) the external PU4) the iPad itself (currently, without screen as we won't know the screen image until Apple launches it).First job will be just a trial to create the renders of the covers for the iPad (see example attached) with the iPad inside, so we can try and replicate 1 or 2 existing images to check the amount of work required for the rest of the project (for both sides!)We need someone who's super skilled in Adobe Substance and able to send over the asset sets after the 1st test.

Due to the sensitive nature of the systems involved, testing must be done in an isolated lab environment that replicates the production server configuration.The initial vulnerability assessment found the server permits connections using SSL 2.0 and 3.0, protocols that are no longer considered secure. To strengthen protections, these will need to be disabled on the server configuration. Additionally, the assessment recommends migrating to TLS 1.2 as the minimum encryption standard, using cipher suites that provide adequate security.The contractor's role will be to test the environment to mirror the production Linux server. Thorough testing is then required to validate all critical business services and applications continue running as expected with the proposed SSL/TLS changes implemented. Once verified, recommendations for applying the same upgrades to the live production server in a planned migration can be provided.The overall goal is to bolster security by eliminating use of outdated and vulnerable protocols while ensuring minimum disruption to operations. Configuring the isolated lab system and thoroughly verifying compatibility and operations across applications is key before any changes go live.Hourly Range: $10.00-$15.00Posted On: February 19, 2024 13:55 UTCCategory: Information SecuritySkills:Vulnerability Assessment, SSL, Linux, Internet Protocol SecuritySkills: Vulnerability Assessment, SSL, Linux, Internet Protocol SecurityCountry: Pakistan\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

Present and make the multifaceted impacts of the fashion industry understandable and clear. We will deal with the implications of the entire supply chain, focusing on the connections between consumption patterns and the environmental and societal consequences of fashion production and distribution.2. The second main section is about helping people navigate this complicated landscape and invite them to engage with sustainable fashion.3. Finally, as we try to bring about a new vision for fashion, anchored in sustainability and principles like sufficiency and wellbeing, there will be an entire section dedicated to showcasing already existing alternatives and address the important things to consider for stakeholders in the sector that would like to incorporate such considerations in their business. We will offer prompts that envision what the fashion industry could look like in a world guided by sustainability.In essence, the deliverable—a comprehensive and user-friendly website—will serve as an invaluable bank of knowledge, equipped with practical tools, and inspirational examples, all aimed at transforming the way individuals perceive, engage with, and contribute to fashion.1.
