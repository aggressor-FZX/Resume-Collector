Four years ago, my co-founder and I launched a video licensing business with the vision of expanding its presence across the US. However, shortly after our venture began, my co-founder returned to Poland, leaving the business's future uncertain.Despite my efforts to propose a fair buyout of my 50% stake in the company, the negotiations have reached a stalemate due to unrealistic counteroffers and a lack of alignment with the current market conditions. Our initial goal was to resolve this matter amicably. Unfortunately, the discussions have veered off course, with proposals that fail to reflect the seriousness of the situation.I require a legal professional who can delineate clear boundaries and articulate a range of scenarios to my co-founder. These scenarios should include, but not be limited to, a potential lawsuit for actions detrimental to the company. The ideal candidate will possess strong negotiation skills, a thorough understanding of corporate law as it applies to Delaware C-Corporations, and experience in resolving co-founder disputes.Your role will involve strategizing the best course of action, ensuring that all legal avenues are explored to protect my interests and those of the business.

Built well from the back and front end.In simple terms, please turn this website into something of high quality that will last me years to come in business, a website build that a professional dev would respect.Of course, I understand that to achieve this it may come with changes which I am open to. Creativity is welcomed.You will be in a group chat with me, my SEO guy and our developer.There will be great communication and you will never be left in the dark about anything. The purpose of this is so that everybody is on the same page and nobody will be able to do anything that harms each other's work. Don't worry they are both very friendly!Before you begin the re-development if you could give an audit or report highlighting some major errors and red flags you found in the build of the site explaining to me why they are problematic and the work you will be carrying out that would be great.Kind regards,TonyHourly Range: $20.00-$40.00Posted On: February 18, 2024 00:48 UTCCategory: Ecommerce Website DevelopmentSkills:WordPress, WooCommerce, Web Development, Web DesignSkills: WordPress, WooCommerce, Web Development, Web DesignCountry: United Kingdom\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

The EA will execute trades based on spread between specified instruments profit/loss and after opening the trades, we need comprehensive trade control. EA will pick the price of given instruments from our given time and date and will assume trades are open from that time and date and will calculate the profit or loss of each instrument in USD ( Or Currency ) and will initiate the trades when spread between these different instrument, s equity will reach at specific level.Key Features:1. Spread Table Visualization: The EA will display a spread table on the chart, comprising 6 lines for different instruments or assets. Each line will consist of 10 boxes for essential details such as symbol, virtual lot size, direction, price, equity, and lot size for trade entry. Please refer to the attached sample picture for visualization.2. Trade Initiation Based on Spread: Trades will be automatically initiated when the spread between designated instruments reaches a specified value.EA will check The pair when spread will reach at our given level. EA will keep the maximum loss side pair direction in same as we set in the table while will change the direction of lower loss or profit side instrument for trade initiate. The EA will calculate and monitor spread differentials as per user-defined parameters.3. Equity-Based Trade Direction: Upon trade initiation, the EA will analyze the equity of involved instruments and determine the optimal trade direction. It will maintain the instrument with lower equity in the current direction and potentially reverse the direction of the other instrument for optimal risk management.4. Control Panel Features: The EA will include a comprehensive control panel with the following functionalities:• Display of starting date and time, with options for auto-update and with given distance.• Presentation of today's starting balance and equity.• Setting of equity and balance cutoff values for closing trades.• Configuration of email alerts for trade notifications.• Customizable trade headings for easy identification in email.• Trailing with 3 extra step. At first level, only jump to break even, Second jump to given profit target, from third trailing till exit with given distance.• Background settings for configuring spread parameters, trade initiation levels, and trade control options.5. Special Considerations and Requirements:• Ensure persistent settings across MT4/MT5 restarts, changes in date/time, timeframe, or instrument.• Address issues related to price freezing, requote, and excessive trading activity, with appropriate error handling mechanisms.• Configure email alerts to trigger only for executed trades, minimizing unnecessary notifications.• Implement safeguards against account closure due to hyperactivity, including the ability to deactivate the EA under certain conditions.• Ensure compliance with market trading hours and margin requirements, preventing trades during closed markets or insufficient margin situations.• Provide unique identification for trades initiated by the EA for precise management actions such as closure, reversal, or trailing.Next Steps: Please review the attached detailed proposal for a comprehensive understanding of the project requirements. We value your expertise and look forward to collaborating with you to bring this EA to life. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the project, please don't hesitate to reach out.Posted On: February 18, 2024 11:13 UTCCategory: Desktop Software DevelopmentSkills:MetaTrader 4, MQL 5, MQL 4, Forex TradingSkills: MetaTrader 4, MQL 5, MQL 4, Forex TradingCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

Like it or not things have changed and this book is about how we can move from being a Good Grandparent to becoming a Great Grandparent.The starting point of this book is the consideration that “Life is complicated, Family life is a multiple of complicated and extended family life is exponentially complicated”. It is with that in mind that I offer you stories, techniques and ideas to weather the family storms that probably will arise when it comes to staying connected to your Grandchildren.Because of the demographic of baby boomers aging into Grandparenthood the time has come to learn what we need to know about Grandparenting in the 21st Century.

My WHY for all of this is to offer our Grandchildren the most Love and support possible as well as keeping some well intentioned Grandparents from being left at the station.I am proud of you for wanting to become an even better Grandparent than you are now.

By integrating cutting-edge IoT technology, we facilitate seamless access to underutilized parking spaces, making urban navigation hassle-free and more environmentally friendly.Monthly Parking Subscriptions: Central to our service is the provision of monthly parking subscriptions at fixed locations, ensuring predictability and convenience for users. This model not only guarantees a reserved spot for commuters but also opens a revenue stream for property owners, tapping into the potential of idle parking spaces during non-business hours. It's an elegant solution to the pressing parking scarcity in metropolitan areas, benefiting both space owners and city dwellers alike.Technological Innovation and User Convenience: At the heart of our platform is real-time tracking of parking space availability, coupled with user-friendly payment options. This dual approach eradicates the uncertainty and frustration often associated with urban parking. The system's backbone, IoT devices installed in vehicles, monitor adherence to parking schedules, safeguarding against misuse and ensuring a smooth operational flow.Sustainability at the Forefront: Our commitment to sustainability is twofold: reducing unnecessary vehicle emissions by minimizing the time drivers spend searching for parking, and promoting a more efficient use of urban spaces. This initiative directly supports the global drive towards greener cities, aligning with efforts to combat climate change and enhance urban air quality.Empowering Urban Communities: Beyond the technicalities, our mission is to foster more livable, breathable urban environments. By simplifying parking, we're not just solving a logistical problem; we're contributing to the broader vision of sustainable urban development. Our service is more than a convenience—it's a step towards a future where cities are defined by their livability, not their congestion.In crafting a smarter, greener future, our smart parking service stands as a beacon of innovation and sustainability. It represents a paradigm shift in how we perceive and utilize urban spaces, heralding a new era of city living that prioritizes efficiency, convenience, and ecological responsibility.Posted On: February 19, 2024 08:48 UTCCategory: Brand Identity DesignSkills:Graphic Design, Logo Design, Brand Identity & Guidelines, Brand Positioning, Brand Guidelines, Corporate Brand Identity, Adobe Illustrator, Illustration, Adobe PhotoshopSkills: Graphic Design, Logo Design, Brand Identity & Guidelines, Brand Positioning, Brand Guidelines, Corporate Brand Identity, Adobe Illustrator, Illustration, Adobe PhotoshopCountry: Bulgaria\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

SPECIFICS DISCUSSED IN MEETING.If you are an entrepreneurial-minded freelancer, then you might be a fit for my new brand agency. Especially if you're tired of grinding away for low pay, dealing with clients, and want to design and develop. Long story short, I am standing up an agency focused on helping men build manly brands (think gyms, construction companies, management coaching, etc.) catering to veterans, go-getters, and those who want to take charge of their lives. Therefore, you need to be that same kind of individual with a passion for success regardless of your hurdles and difficulties.You must be proficient with WordPress, Squarespace, and Shopify, as that is what many of my clients use or desire to use. You must be able to build the websites, not simply design them; therefore, you must be a designer and developer. It would help if you had a generalized idea of branding, marketing, and so forth, as that will be useful in bringing the websites to life. You will NOT be expected to maintain the websites as we are a branding agency, and continual maintenance falls outside of our day-to-day purview at this time.This is a unique opportunity for the right person to stay a freelancer while teaming up with a business to build a steady stream of business for themselves via my agency. As it stands now, I take care of all client intake, issues, and relationships, which means you will interface with me and be required to design and build sites. While I am slowly gaining more and more work, you will be an independent contractor responsible for your schedule, taxes, and so on. However, that also means that you will be setting the rates and so forth.If this sounds like an opportunity, I want to see what you have. Include reviews, samples of your work, and a resume if you have one.

Specifically, to create a new user journey and design for volunteer projects, where participants would receive an instant confirmation upon registering and have the ability to invite friends to join.**Background & About Time Auction**[Time Auction]([REDACTED_URL] is a charity that advocates volunteerism. We encourage volunteering with inspiring experiences, while connecting skilled-volunteers with NGOs. Our platform matches individuals who want to volunteer their talent with nonprofits that need those skills. Since 2014, over 230,000 volunteer hours have been contributed by the Time Auction community.Currently, NGOs can post skilled volunteer projects, where volunteers can apply and fill in details such as a self-introduction and LinkedIn profile. NGOs will receive the applications and select suitable candidates to reach out for an interview. Due to the popularity of some of these projects, only about 25% of project applications successfully receive an offer from the NGO to conduct the project, resulting in disappointment for the majority of volunteers who did not receive an offer.**We would like to add a new function to the project posting process, with an objective to further utilize the matching platform by lowering the barriers to application and speeding up the process.** For certain projects that NGOs do not need to interview the candidates (such as helpers to sell flags on Flag Day), volunteers can register and instantly receive a confirmation with instructions on how to join (e.g., meet at MTR at 10 am on the day). Additionally, volunteers can also invite and register their friends to join these instantly confirmed volunteer opportunities.As a UX/UI designer, your responsibilities will include creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes, which will be used for Usability Testing with a small number of NGOs and volunteers. You will work closely with our Product Manager and development team to implement the design.### Features addedThe UX/UI designer will review our existing user experience from both a volunteer and NGO perspective and create a new additional workflow for these instantly confirmed projects. The interfaces that will be enhanced and designed include:- **Volunteer sign-up process**, including registration, invitation, confirmation, and other relevant elements- **NGO post-project process**, including the option to select the registration method as instant confirmation, additional questions and/or terms, the option to include custom rich-text instructions which volunteers will receive upon confirmation, and other relevant elements- **Projects page** ([REDACTED_URL] **filter and Project preview cards** so users can easily identify and filter instantly confirmed projects- **Our backend admin system** with relevant fields and info displayed for our team to review and edit if neededThe goal of this redesign is to enable volunteers to easily sign up for volunteer projects that they can join and allow NGOs to post more types of volunteer opportunities on our platform.### Responsibilities- Communicate with our team and/or users to understand the needs, goals, and pain points when engaging with our platform- Develop user personas and user journey maps to guide the design process, as well as user acceptance test to collect feedback- Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to illustrate design ideas and concepts- Work with our Product Manager and Developers to ensure the design is implemented effectively and efficiently- Ensure the design aligns with the brand identity and meets the business objectives- 1-2 days per week in our office would be preferredTo apply, please email hongkong[at]timeauction.org with the subject line \"UXUI Designer - [your name]\".

Please try to make a good proposal because they will be scrutinized.I will trial a few of you, and whoever can come up clutch like Kobe will have a lot of work in the next few months for this current project.Pay rate will increase as you move along, including for non-US freelancers. I want to give someone a steady and stable role in my operation.I run a media \"business\". It's really just me. I have hired a few freelancers in the past but this will be my first time expanding to something more consistent.I have a background as a professional in video production. I know After Effects and Premiere very well. I am good but not great at photoshop. And absolute shite at illustrator and indesign. Please type 'agora' at the beginning of your reply so I know you read instructions. For the past few months I have been tasked with running a client's entire social media and marketing, and this includes a lot of still designs.I will need you to be available, probably for 10-15 hours a week, to take on extra workload. What that workload will consist of will depend on your skill set: I could use everything, illustration, typography, vector, raster, motion design, etc. Some of the projects we will be collaborating on: you will finish my designs, or sometimes you will build the base and I will finish the design. This is going to be a collaborative role. I need someone who above all is RELIABLE. I'm a dumb artsy fartsy type that struggles in the corporate world. So I gotta have someone here who is ready to work and just get it done. I value high quality work but I also know how long it takes and how much care it takes. It's above the pay grade here. I need someone to plug and play. That's it. And if you show you can do that I'll give you other opportunities and more humanizing gigs.I have subscription to Envato Elements, Artlist, and Motion Array. As well as Sound Strip and a few other stock services. So you will have access to all of those libraries.I really like retro pastels and paper textures and pop art. The client you will be servicing has a whole line of ads that are pictures of him turned into illustration (posterize, and blend colors) that looks like a comic. Stuff like that, more vintage designs, lots of bloom. That's what I do and what I like.

I of course deleted the meta description from the section which makes it so it's added to all pages, which should have removed it but it did not.

Typically achieved measurable time savings (e.g., up to 30-60%) through automation.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Hello, hope you are well. I have began development on a website but need someone else to finish it off. After the project is completed and I am satisfied with the end result, I will be happy to save your profile and do more work with you in the future. I need this project completed by 25th February maximum.The site is on WordPress being built with Elementor. Two pages and a header, the homepage, the form page and the header. I have already built the about us page and half completed the header which I need you to finish off. The design for both desktop and mobile pages is all done, it just needs to be built. There is also an interesting functionality that I need done which I'll explain further below.If you need to download free plugins, you may do so. If you need a paid plugin to continue work, please consult me before purchase and I will look into it. As of now, you will have access to the three plugins:- Elementor- Essential Addons for Elementor- Premium Addons for ElementorLogins for the site will be given upon hire.The site is for Muslims that are looking for local mosques that do Taraweeh (a type of prayer during Ramadan) all across Australia. They hop on and view/filter through a variety of variables. Additionally, there is a form that mosque owners can fill out to have their mosque be apart of the website database.Now for this project, I need the form to be built and automated in a way where once filled out, the admin of the website receives an email and can either check the submission on his email and on WordPress to make sure the information is accurate and then has the option to select either \"Approve\" or \"Reject\". If rejected, the submission does not go through and is deleted. However, if the admin clicks \"Approve\" then the information submitted should automatically be inputted in the table and shown as an option on the homepage. We do not want to manually enter all results into the table as we receive hundreds of submissions, it has to be automatic. You do not have to input all the mosque details on the home page design. Just 3 of them after the functionality is built to make sure everything is working correctly.Now for specific notes in regards to the form page. For the 'address' field, I need it to be linked where it automatically gives results based on what the user types and the user is forced to select their address from the results shown. In order to prevent users mistyping or providing an incorrect address.For the 'Isha'a/Taraweeh Time' field. I want that to be a dropdown with times between 6pm-10pm in increments of 15min (e.g 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, etc).For the 'Number of Taraweeh prayer units' field. I also want that as a dropdown with the options: 8, 11, 20, 8 + Witr, 11 + Witr, 20+Witr.For the 'Best places to park?' field, I just want to remind that it is to be shown underneath the address on the homepage table as per the design image.Just reminding one more time, I need this project done by 25th February max. Any further questions, we can discuss later. Thank you for your time and looking forward to working with you.Budget: $250Posted On: February 14, 2024 06:16 UTCCategory: CMS DevelopmentSkills:WordPress, Elementor, CSS, JavaScript, Web Development, PHP, HTML, WordPress DevelopmentSkills: WordPress, Elementor, CSS, JavaScript, Web Development, PHP, HTML, WordPress DevelopmentCountry: Australia\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

Solution:Create a custom plugin based on the existing Datasmith functionalities, but with enhanced capability to directly access material settings, especially those related to V-Ray.

Expected Outcome:- Client Side:The plugin will access material settings in a scene, log the list of materials along with all their bitmaps, geometry mapping, and shader nodes. It will output a modified version of the Datasmith files, including all material data, and produce a process log.- Server Side:During import sessions, the modified Datasmith files will guide the import engine in reconstructing a version of the materials based on the import log. This reconstructed material will be a hybrid of existing templates, categorized by material type (e.g., metallic, caustic, SSS, etc.), with additional modifying nodes to closely resemble the original material inputs.Familiarity is needed with the following skills/programs:3ds MaxVisual StudioC/C++Unreal EngineDatasmithRelevant documentation:1) Datasmith SDK: [REDACTED_URL] When you download the Datasmith SDK as instructed by the documentation, there are many code examples you can familiarize yourself with and build upon.
