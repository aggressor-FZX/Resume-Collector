The system's primary objective is to securely store and manage tenant data while providing functionalities for monitoring digital card balances and automating notifications regarding remaining balances. It encompasses the storage and management of various tenant details, including names, contact information, and digital card balances, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and data protection standards.User management features include support for multiple user roles, such as tenants and management, each with specific permissions and access levels, enforced through robust user authentication mechanisms. Tenants are empowered to create and maintain their profiles with accurate and up-to-date information, including mandatory fields like full name, contact information, and Section 8 identification number, with optional fields for address and emergency contact details.The system effectively tracks and manages digital card balances associated with each tenant, allowing management to update balances manually or automatically based on transactions. Furthermore, it supports automated notifications to alert both tenants and management regarding digital card balances, with tenants receiving alerts via text message or email when their balance falls below a predetermined threshold, and management receiving notifications concerning low balances and overdue payments.In addition to functional requirements, non-functional aspects such as security, performance, and reliability are of paramount importance. The system must comply with industry-standard security protocols to protect sensitive PII data, including encryption for data transmission and storage, along with access controls to prevent unauthorized access. It must also be capable of efficiently handling a large volume of tenant data and transactions, with acceptable response times and scalability to accommodate future growth. Reliability is ensured through built-in redundancy, backup mechanisms, and regular maintenance to proactively address potential issues.The system's architecture is structured around a relational database to optimize data storage and retrieval, with a modular and scalable application architecture utilizing a combination of frontend and backend technologies. The user interface design prioritizes user-friendliness and responsiveness, providing intuitive navigation and clear layouts for managing profiles and monitoring digital card balances.Legal and compliance considerations include adherence to requirements for handling personal data and compliance with Section 8 regulations governing housing programs, ensuring data retention policies are established to align with program requirements. An implementation plan outlines development phases from requirements analysis to deployment, with comprehensive testing strategies to validate the system against requirements. Ongoing maintenance and technical support are essential for addressing bugs, security vulnerabilities, and user inquiries efficiently, ensuring the system's continued reliability and performance.Hourly Range: $25.00-$50.00Posted On: February 16, 2024 16:56 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:PHP, Database Design, Python, Database, Microsoft AzureSkills: PHP, Database Design, Python, Database, Microsoft Azure\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered python-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.

We also build different outdoor structures such as raise bed kitchen gardens, grillzebos (outdoor kitchens), greenhouses, workshops, and garages.A number of our customers have asked us to build custom cabinets, shelves, closets, doors, trim/custom moldings etc. Here's the issue we have ran into:As you fully well know, in tech when a client has a vision it's sometimes hard to pull it out of them. What they \"see\" and what you hear are often two different things. In tech, we write detailed specs, scopes, flow diagrams, and mock ups to clear everything with a client. In construction? Heh. We paint with words. And sometimes that's just not enough.So... we've purchased a CNC machine capable of producing parts and pieces. Eg. in the US we use a standard dimension board called a 2x6 for framing exterior walls. Let's say that a plan requires 14 2x6x10 boards. Well I need to be able to produce one of those boards to a scale of 1 Inch:1 Foot. So a 2 x 6 x 10 foot board would become 2x6x10 inches.I need that 10 inch board rendered first in AutoCad and then converted to GCode so the CNC machine can cut it out.So here's the project and why this is an hourly. We are going to produce scaled pieces required to build an entire house or anything else we want to model.That's a large variety of wood, flooring, wall materials, flooring, cabinets, countertops, cabinets, mocked up appliances, and fixtures.Please provide examples of your work and confirm your daily hourly availability. I do run a team of India based programmers Monday - Friday from 10p to 10a Chicago time. That's India's day time working hours.

IntroductionThis design document outlines the proposed software that will aid in streamlining maintenance tasks, particularly focusing on employee time tracking, material purchases, cost estimation, and comparison, as well as building and HVAC maintenance management.2.

We would form a team for this project.This project is NOT about super bulk email series.Since i live in Germany, the market is small. This is why my approach is based on quality.This is why i need personilized email automations.Must have Criterias are:1) I want to record a video via Loom or similar and show the Domain of the lead (Screen recording)2) This video should always say the same thing3) But I don't want to record a video manually for each lead... I need to automate it - Videos should be auto-generated and the links saved in a csv file or something. I saw that it is possible to do this with expensive software. You just have to upload a voice recording and the video gets built. Now I am looking for an alternative.Nice to have criteria (please mention this in your application, if you have experience with this):1) If possible - saying the name of the lead in the video and replacing the name with AI or something similar to get even more personalization. I only saw software for the Englisch language till now... not sure how to do this in German.2) Showing a video of me in the corner of the screen-recording.3) If you can do this without loom, it is okay to - but it has to have a link which has a gif. Loom Videos have gif previews, which I want to have in the cold emails.I am willing to buy software, if necessary.I have no email service or anything else ready - Everything has to be done and set up in a correct way.

The application should start with a Google Sheets list of companies, select 200-300 per day, and append the reviews to a new sheet per company.Integration with Proxy Services: Leverage third-party scraping tools or services such as scrape.do, Oxylabs, or ScrapingBee to facilitate data extraction while mitigating the risk of IP blocking.Interface Design: Create a simple, basic interface for non-technical users to interact with the scraping tools, including initiating scrapes and monitoring progress.QualificationsProven experience in web scraping and data extraction projects.Proficiency in programming languages suitable for web scraping (e.g., Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium).Experience with third-party scraping tools or services (scrape.do, Oxylabs, ScrapingBee, etc.).

I am a new fantasy author attempting to build a WordPress website to act as a central hub for the world. This includes a place for short stories, art, a shop to buy the book direct, and a place to communicate with readers. I have purchased the domain and hosting, and believe that I have a basic layout for what I want the main page to look like. However, I have struggled learning the tools necessary to complete the job and am now looking to hire a professional. The issues holding me back the most is creating links and attaching pages, as well as creating a heading that shows up on every page of the site. While style is important, I am wanting my website to be user friendly, fast, and secure above all else.I am looking for a collaboration and communication is very important to me. While I want to let the professional take the lead, I would like to learn a little as well so I can feel comfortable managing and updating the website after the project is complete. Don't worry, I am not looking for a teacher to learn a new profession. I simply would like know how to upload a new short story myself so I don't have to hire someone every time.This project would begin next Tuesday, February 20 and I would like to start off with a meeting (message, voice, or video chat) where we go over what I have together and come up with a plan. My budget is a bit flexible, as this is the most important project I have hired for on Upwork, so please include your fee in your proposal.

We do have CV’s already written, but I feel like they could be updated to a more current-looking and informative/engaging version. Depending on price, we may also want Cover Letters as well. One of the issues we’ve come across is that our current CV’s recent work experience look extremely similar (or at points, exactly the same), as we work closely together and have many of the same job duties. This has been fine up until recently, when we realised we may start applying for the same jobs and obviously can’t turn in similar CV’s.For some background information, I (Laura) am a wildlife ecologist and conservation manager, and have been in this field for many years. I am hoping to apply for other wildlife-focused jobs, including wildlife rehabilitation, management, sanctuary, and release jobs. I am also possibly applying to wildlife veterinarian medical schools.My colleague, has a varied background until I hired him to work in my current wildlife department. He has worked as a commercial diver, security manager, and hospitality. So his CV needs to be better tailored to specific jobs he is applying for, which I think means he may need two different CV’s (one for wildlife and hospitality jobs, and one for construction and commercial diving jobs).I was wondering if this sounds like something that would be possible for you to do, and approximately the total cost of the job (as we are in the wildlife conservation field, the total cost will be important to determine haha).I look forward to hearing your reply!Best wishes,LauraPosted On: February 14, 2024 14:03 UTCCategory: Resume & Cover Letter WritingSkills:Art & Design, Resume Writing, Resume, Cover Letter Writing, English, Resume Design, Writing, Resume Development, Content Writing, Wildlife IllustrationSkills: Art & Design, Resume Writing, Resume, Cover Letter Writing, English, Resume Design, Writing, Resume Development, Content Writing, Wildlife IllustrationCountry: Kenya\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hello, name, laura-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
