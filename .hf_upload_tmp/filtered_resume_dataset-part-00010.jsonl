Some elements are adopted directly from the Oregon flag design, while the majority are emblems of our business.We are making a 15 year anniversary design, with the our version of the beaver on the pocket area of the shirt and the emblem on the back. It will be screen-printed on, a one-color print._______________________________More Details/Specific Requests: [See attached brief file for full context]Beaver: [See in files]The beaver just needs a vector made of it as well as any print-ready file. The EW logo in the handle of the Beaver’s shovel is our company’s logo.Emblem: [See in files]All items adopted from the Oregon flag design need to be double checked for accuracy. There is a Vector file of the emblem available online or in attached files.Items from the Oregon Flag:Emblem: double check shape and thicknessStars: double check size, placement of the top two stars and the bottom one star need to be the same as the flag. The spacing between the 15 stars needs to be universal/the same.Bird: double check accuracy, we have not modified the bird or the wheat in its left hand. We HAVE modified the “arrows” in the right hand to tools that we use [see next section].Mt Hood: From the original design, slightly modified to add emptiness. Double check shape of mountain and peak is accurate, it’s what gives Mt Hood its name.Sun: The sun has been moved from the placement on the Oregon flag to the top of the center. Please recreate the sun and its rays to match the OR flag style, but keep sun in current location.Trees: The trees on the felt have been moved from the right side of the Oregon emblem and duplicated to fill space. Double check the moved trees for accuracy and add more to fill it out as it shows in our design.Banner with “Job Done Right”: Banner should be accurate; the slogan is our own.“Environmental Works” text and “2009” are in the style of Oregon flag, we have changed the scale to make the full company name fit and decreased the size of the date. Please just recreate from the design.___Items not from the flag were made by me, to represent our business and what we offer. Some of them I want to remain the same, most I want modifications or artistic updates for.Items from our business/made by me:Bird’s items: Spade, pipe wrench, wrench. Keep as is, unless you can make the three read better. The arrows on the original are small, so we need to stick to that scale.Columbia River: A simple design that “passes under” the banner. Keep island in the center and feel free to make modifications that would represent the Columbia River more accurately, or leave as is.Excavator: Please redraw to fit the style and to add some perspective. I like the bucket style but the body needs a professional touch.Shovel and dig site: Redraw if needed. Keep the soil mounds visible in some way, it connects the excavator, Heating Oil Tank, and dump truck all together.Heating Oil Tank: Move if need be, keep design as is.Dump Truck: Redraw. I like the style generally, but I think an expert could finish it better.Radon System (with house): Modify house if needed, keep Radon System fan as designed.Wrench: Feel free to redrawHard Hat: Please redraw. I like the scale but my art is not the best.Mostly I just want a re-finishing of the emblem that I’ve sent over. Our team knew it’d be a packed design so we wanted to get all of the brainstorming out of the way and focus on beautifying the output.If you want to make creative modifications, please chat with me about them!

We can ignore prior to 2024 because it is so many entries. I’ve already asked if there is a way for ML to do this on the back end and the answer is no.- SDS Airstream- SDS Internal- SDS Employee Admin- SDS others?- Onbaording/offboarding?Figure out how to handle projects that are fixed fee and go over budget (i.e. tesla) from a reporting standpoint. I want to know in the margin report how we did.- I don’t want overages to look like ‘billable’ hours. This will give us a much better picture.- Maybe we have a ‘overbudget’ task that is always non-billable on a project and we can bill to that for fixed bid tasks. This would prevent the budget from going red and also prevent the margin report from getting all screwed up. (The margin report doesn’t seem to care if we go above the original budget, it just keeps adding ‘billable’ income to the project.- Can also manually mark time entries as non-billable in ML or make all tasks non-billable when a project goes over budget. I’ve put in a request to have this feature added or have a bulk modify feature added for changing a bunch of time entries to non-billable all at once.Figure out how to handle time off and sick days. Right now, they are showing up as ‘worked’ time in ML and they really are not. Ideally, they don’t show up in the ML utilization reports. The goal is to not have to download and manipulate data, if possible.- For Salary Employees- PTO should not show up in the utilization report. We can not track it, if desired. Or we can use the ML vacation tool.- Same with UPTO, although UPTO should not affect the monthly hours average in a negative way, so perhaps this will still need to be tracked in a project and show up in the utilization report..- For Hourly employees- PTO should not show up in the utilization report. We can not track it, if desired. Or we can use the ML vacation tool.- Same with UPTO. If someone isn’t working, they should just not fill out their timesheet. Hourly team members are not required to hit a monthly moving average, so this should be OK to not include in the utilization report- Unpaid hourly employee lunches shouldn’t show up in the utilization report, ideally. Perhaps we can stop logging it and just log the breaks? We could have them request it as vacation every day?- Solution is to create two or more groups:- SDS and Client Working Projects- Consists of all client projects and any SDS ‘work’- Does Not include PTO, UPTO, Sick, (or Unpaid lunches for hourly employees)- SDS PTO-UPTO-Sick-Lunch- includes PTO, UPTO, Sick, (or Unpaid lunches for hourly employees)- Once the groups are in place, you can run the utilization report with a Group filter for SDS and Client Working Projects Group and that will show you what you want to see.Hourly Range: $30.00-$60.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 17:53 UTCCategory: Business Applications DevelopmentCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

I'm reaching out regarding the mixing/mastering of my Genesis track, and I'm excited to collaborate with you on this project. To ensure we're on the same page, I want to provide clear instructions on what I'm looking for:1. **Enhanced Bass and Power for Vocals**: I'd like my voice to carry more bass and power to provide a stronger presence in the track. This should help elevate the overall impact and intensity.2. **Boosted Beat**: I want the beat to be more prominent in the mix. It should have a noticeable presence without overpowering the other elements of the track.3. **Clearer Vocals**: It's crucial to me that my vocals are clear and intelligible. They should seamlessly blend into the background of the track while still maintaining their clarity and distinction.I trust your expertise in audio engineering and mastering to achieve these goals effectively. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out. I apologize that I only have the .mp3 file. I understand if this limits what you can do. Let me know what file type of the song you’d need.Looking forward to hearing your magic on the Genesis track!Best regards,Inspektah G.A.D.Budget: $100Posted On: February 14, 2024 04:28 UTCCategory: Audio EditingSkills:Audio Editing, Sound Mixing, Audio Engineering, Music Production, Logic Pro, Music Arrangement, Music & Sound Design, Audio Effects, MusicSkills: Audio Editing, Sound Mixing, Audio Engineering, Music Production, Logic Pro, Music Arrangement, Music & Sound Design, Audio Effects, MusicCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

We do this by keeping track of everything happening on our app. For that, we use a tool called Mixpanel, which is like putting tiny sensors all over the app. These sensors tell us:* What products people are looking at by recording every time someone clicks on an item.* How popular each product is by counting the clicks and how often they're added or removed from shopping carts.* Where each product is popular, so we can map out the best-sellers in every city.* Where our users are, pinpointing the cities they come from.* When our app gets the most action, like the busiest times for views, cart adds, and clicks.We also want to know our customers as if they're friends. This means for every user, say John, we'll know:* His location, contact details, and what he likes to buy the most.* How much time he spends browsing different categories.* His shopping habits—what days and times he usually buys, how much he spends monthly and in total.* His app activity—how long he spends on the app, when he's most active, and how quickly he makes decisions to add things to his cart and check out.All of this information needs to be easy to understand at a glance, which is why we'll use charts and visuals to display it.Hourly Range: $20.00-$35.00Posted On: February 16, 2024 18:46 UTCCategory: Data EngineeringSkills:Data Engineering, Data Analysis Consultation, Mixpanel, Data AnalysisSkills: Data Engineering, Data Analysis Consultation, Mixpanel, Data AnalysisCountry: Canada\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

The way it works is that people top up with local currency and then they can choose a room where they can play the game. The system matches them and gives the winnings to the winner.This is the website of the platformwww.playwinclub.comHere I detail more of what is needed- Develop the Web Version so that it is possible to run the APP from any browser by entering a link through the website- Create events like tournaments (With an event manager)- Be able to create events to raise funds through a tournament- When a crash occurs in Dominoes the game ends there- The last player who played (Only when it is a lock) that is, the one who won comes out first in the next round when this is not the case, the next one on the right comes out.- We will put the tables of 4 First in the games, 4,3,2- 2vs2 mode in Dominoes where the winning couple shares the prize- Revenge button at the end of the Game in ludo and Dominoes- Email Verification Code- Password reset code is not being sent- Expand Dominoes- Allowing the user to be able to see their pieces in Dominoes whenever they want. I don't know if it is easier for us to leave it on the purple button, or for them to always be able to see their pieces, which means that they are always there on the screen without having to press the button. morodo- Remove the \"X\" lock system in ludo- Check the problem when sending notifications to everyone- Users can see how many there are searching for a game in the rooms- That they can activate to receive notifications to play in the rooms- Lower the Domino points to 75 in games of two and 3 in games of 4, we are going to leave them at 100 points- Show user ID in Profile- Add BSC in the ad and USDT- Put a button or something on the website that refers or says that you can play online- Add the phone number to the verification when registering and if you are going to make a mobile payment withdrawal it must be to that same phone number, you must send a verification code to that phone number as well- Review the games that were stuck- When you search for a player in the administrative panel, for example, look for ID 20, it also shows me 1020 and 820, so you have to turn the page to get to 20, that is, you go from page 1 to page 2. When you do this, it takes you to all users lose the search for ID 20- Sound a toptop when the player passes in dominoes- Let a little sign appear that says pass and that the other player passed- The roulette wheel for the player to spin daily, with a free spin and coin prizes- Two users told me that when they play dominoes they have seen that the other player passes and although there are coins in the pot to steal, they do not steal, I don't know if this happens to me, but it would be good to review it.- We can put where it says Chips knows that a number comes out by counting the white rentangle chips referring to the back of the chips- Translate the word resynchronizing and let's say that the connection was lost, we are resynchronizing something like this so that people understand that their internet went down and that is why the game is being resynchronized.- In the store we are going to divide or put a sign that says Cryptocurrencies USDT and below for the contact us local currency because people are making purchases that they never complete because they simply give them to buy and that's it, but it's because they don't know- It occurs to me to remove the Telegram group and WhatsApp chat buttons to the main screen so that people can see them easier, it could be below the left- When we ban a player, do not let them enter the app anymore and put a message that says you have been banned or expelled for violating our terms, contact support and when you click on it, it takes them to the WhatsApp chat.

This is made possible through our comprehensive Done-For-You services, designed specifically for those who may not have the necessary time or literary skills to write a book themselves. Among our unique services, we offer 'angel writing', a more affectionate term for what is commonly known as ghostwriting.We're currently looking to fill the position of an 'angel writer,' or ghostwriter. This role involves carrying out detailed interviews with our clients for each chapter, grasping their individual ideas, messages, and stories, and then writing the book on their behalf, effectively capturing their unique voices.We have an exciting client who is keen on publishing a book with us. Here's the fundamental idea of the book for you to review:Q1. Can you provide a brief overview of your book's idea?-Welcome to 100 Million Dollar Habits: My Journey to Success and How You Can Get There, Too. This is not just another book trying to sell you a grand idea, mainly because there are plenty of that already out there and I'm not selling anything. I have built my path in life, now I'm trying to help others see the reality of getting there is not a path that others can't achieve on their own. It's an invitation to join me on a journey I have undertaken myself, transforming my life through the power of daily habits. When you see the title, $100,000,000 I want to ensure you understand that it's not some get-rich-quick plan but rather share the key principle of consistency and showing up.Q2. What's your motivation for writing this book?-I have acheived a high level of success in my life and while many people think it's from a dental background (and I want to share a high level overview as a preface)Q3. What advantage or value will a reader gain from your book?-Not just talking high level points but actively sharing my own story and how it applied to me directly. First I wanted to do these things for 15 years and then share stories on how to get there. Once the book is written I want to use it as a template to create social media content to ultimately boost my brand.Q4. What style and narrative voice are you envisioning for your book?-Alex Homozi style - using lots of simple diagrams, stoytelling, and keep the reader at or below a 5th grade level to make it relatable to all.Q5. Lastly, what are your expectations from your Angel Writer?-To truly ensure they have read and understand the 2 core authors I'm trying to blend - James Clear and Alex Hormozi. I would like an angel writer who is familiar with their concepts, as I want to reference these frequently in our exchanges.Finally, the writing quality needs to be top-notch.---Understanding these answers will give you a clearer perspective on our client's vision for their book. We're keen to know why you believe you're the ideal Angel Writer for this project. Please elaborate on this point, as it could significantly boost your chances of selection!Your response will be presented to our clients, allowing them to gauge your book-writing abilities and determine whether they wish to collaborate with you.Helpful hint: Respond to these inquiries as though you're directly addressing the client. We anticipate building long-term relationships with our Angel Writers.Additionally, please share your insights about the client's book idea.Best of luck!

I want many people looking in to the camera and saying the word \"Mizunara\" in different ways. Surprised, amazed, excited, however you want, but with distinction! If you have an unusual look or accent that is great, male, female, young, old, we want everyone. The background should be blurred or not desecrating. There should be no other sounds in the video. If you like you can look at a glass of whiskey, or wine, or a cocktail.Please send the videos to me in both landscape and vertical format. These can and should be just a few seconds. Please only send your best.Background: Mizunara is a rare japanese oak. During WWII the US stopped trade with Japan. Japanese whiskey producers needed barrels and mizunara was the only oak that grows in Japan. Unfortunately, these trees must be 200 years old to make enough straight wood to create barrels. The flavor this wood imparts on the whiskey is amazing with rich vanilla and notes of sandalwood. I just imported some of this oak and it is the first time it has been available in the USA. Most people don't make whiskey but I want them to add some of this oak to boring bottles of spirits they have at home. It will allow people to improve spirits at home, making them exciting again. Hopefully, we will inspire wine and beer producers to also explore using mizunara. If we start a trend I want to create a mizunara flavored canned water. I currently make this at home and it is delicious.

And add 3 subsites (existing domains I have)These subsites are also hosted by cloudways on the same server. I'm not concerned at this time about keeping any of the content on these subsites. The pages and posts from the primary domain will be copied over to the subsites. Then I will edit each site to give new branding and modify some of the content.Also, I will use the plugin WooMultistore to manage the woocommerce store on the subsites. Customers at any of the subsites would be able to login with their credentials from the primary site.I have not tested the WooMultistore plugin but, it looks like the right choice for managing the stores, inventory, and customers on the subsites. Once the subsites are created I will install the plugin and configure it the best I can. I would then ask that you be available for any troubleshooting if issues arise.When complete, the subsites will appear to any visitors that they are stand alone domains. Each subsite will use the Astra Pro theme with possible template changes.I would like to have a common media library that serves all the subsites as I do have a lot of images on the primary site and don't want to duplicate that.Also, when complete the permalink structure of the primary domain must stay intact. For example: [REDACTED_URL] or [REDACTED_URL] bought the domains thru godaddy and can provide all access needed.My primary domain and YouTube channel is broad in it's scope. With the subsites I'd like to narrow that down and focus on the content, items, and videos that have been most popular.Let me know if this is possible.Thank youKentHourly Range: $20.00-$40.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 19:08 UTCCategory: CMS DevelopmentSkills:WordPress, WordPress Multisite, WooCommerce, PHP, CSSSkills: WordPress, WordPress Multisite, WooCommerce, PHP, CSSCountry: Canada\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}
