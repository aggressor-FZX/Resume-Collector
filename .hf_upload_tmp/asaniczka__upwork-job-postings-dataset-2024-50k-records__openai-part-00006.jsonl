You used the online store to order and pay for a tow. You chose Stripe as the payment processor. It accepted your $500 deposit and put it on \"hold\". The tow truck arrived and towed you to your garage. The tow truck driver submitted his final mileage/gas/time totalling $200 to the tow truck company. The tow truck company adds their $100 service fee to make a total of $300. They submit $300 as the capture amount to Stripe and receive it in their account. The tow truck company sends the driver $150 (the company keeps $50 as a service fee) and so they make $150. The remaining $200 is released back to your card as available funds. That completes it.How do they do the deposit part? It's described in Stripe's documentation here:[REDACTED_URL] you prefer Paypal's documentation:[REDACTED_URL] request needs to come from somewhere. It could be a form like WPforms. It could be out of the box from woocommerce. There likely needs to be integration with plugins like Quickbooks or Expensify. The data needs to be stored somewhere like Google Sheets. It also requires a booking plugin integration with something like WPamelia or another with a round robin feature. We might need a hidden strand to assign to the order.If you're familiar with what I've described you're likely a good fit.This isn't about site design or layout.

We want it to have efficient cooling that is quiet, as well as a display that looks great. It should be built out of materials that make it feel high quality and solid. We want it to be lightweight and easy to store, but still be powerful and have a sleek design, and boast a long battery life as well as quick charging times. Basically...the holy grail of laptops, if that makes sense.The main limiting factor is the price of this...we were hoping to have this product for sale at around $600-$800. I was very loose with the requirements, using general terminology, for this reason - if your team could find that balance between power and affordability, that would be great. Of course selling it at around $600 would mean manufacturing it at around $300-$400. (All prices in USD)It is okay if you borrow components that are already made from other manufacturers to make this, and we can definitely incorporate diversification under one product. (How Apple charges more money for more storage on the same iPhone, for example.)We plan to fund this buy using income from pre-orders...so keeping the development and manufacturing as cheap as possible is essential.As of right now, I have three major concerns:1. How much will this cost to develop?2. Is this even possible with today's technology?3. When we are ready to develop this, how long will it take?For a little bit of context, this is a start up, and we have no connections anywhere...we're building this up from scratch.If you have any ideas as to what could help make this laptop more appealing, please do add those as you go. Like I said before, we want this to be the \"holy grail\" of laptops.If you could contact me that would be appreciated about this job, that would be appreciated.

The microgrid system will be modeled in MATLAB Simulink, representing the lines as frequency-dependent Bergeron distributed line models. Detailed representations of power inverters and other components of the microgrid system will be included.Different operating modes of the network and fault scenarios will be simulated to test the performance of the proposed fault detection and classification algorithm. This will involve setting up various fault conditions and disturbances to evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness.The algorithm for fault detection and classification, based on the Boosting Ensemble Method and minimal overlap discrete wavelet Transform, will be implemented in MATLAB. This will involve processing the current signals from both ends of the line, extracting features using signal processing methods, and training the Brownboost ensemble algorithm.The algorithm will be tested and validated using the simulated microgrid scenarios. Performance metrics such as fault detection accuracy, classification results, and robustness to noise and synchronization errors will be evaluated during the simulations.The results of the simulations will be analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in fault detection and classification in microgrids.

The jar for the body oils is square so we've used two labels (front and back) to date but could convert to one label if the design makes sense. The ingredients could also go on a label on the bottom of the jar for design aesthetic.We'd like to include some color on the labels that relates to the color of each chakra, while ensuring the design still feels natural and organic. (Root - red, Sacral - orange, Solar - yellow, Heart - green, Throat - blue, Third eye - indigo, Crown - purple). It's important that the branding is cohesive between our tea bags and the body oil/candle/bath soaks labels.We'd like the chakra symbol and affirmation for each product to be the prominent focus of the labels.Links to the product lines we'd like designed are here:[REDACTED_URL] attached photos of the tea bags we'd like the labels to be cohesive with.

This project aims to delve into the intricacies of fan culture, fandom communities, and the impact of music on individuals’ lives. Given the sensitive nature of intellectual property rights and potential legal implications surrounding the portrayal of real-life entities, I recognize the necessity of expert legal counsel to navigate these complexities.**Project Overview:**The proposed book revolves around a group of avid fans of a well-known rock band, exploring themes of passion, loyalty, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy within fan communities. While the narrative primarily focuses on fictional characters and events, it incorporates elements inspired by real-life experiences and the cultural influence of the music industry.**Scope of Legal Assistance:**1. **Intellectual Property Rights:** Assessing the usage of copyrighted material, trademarks, and likenesses associated with the rock band and its members to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.2. **Defamation and Privacy Concerns:** Reviewing character portrayals, plotlines, and any potentially controversial content to mitigate risks of defamation, invasion of privacy, or misrepresentation of real individuals.3. **Licensing and Permissions:** Advising on the necessity of obtaining licenses or permissions for references to song lyrics, album titles, concert venues, and other copyrighted material, as well as negotiating agreements where applicable.4. **Fan Community Representation:** Providing guidance on accurately depicting fan culture and community dynamics while respecting the rights and privacy of real-life fans and enthusiasts.5. **Contractual Agreements:** Drafting or reviewing contracts with publishers, distributors, and other relevant parties to safeguard my rights and interests in the creative work.**Qualifications:**I am seeking a legal professional with expertise in entertainment law, intellectual property rights, and contract negotiation, preferably with prior experience advising authors, artists, or media producers in similar creative projects. Familiarity with the music industry and fan culture dynamics would be advantageous.**Timeline and Budget:**The project timeline is flexible, with an estimated duration of legal consultation spanning several months to accommodate manuscript development, revisions, and publishing preparations. The budget allocation for legal services will be negotiated based on the scope of work, hourly rates, and anticipated complexities of the project.**Conclusion:**In summary, I believe that securing comprehensive legal advice is essential to the success and integrity of my fictional book project involving fans of a popular rock band. By engaging a qualified legal consultant, I aim to ensure regulatory compliance, mitigate legal risks, and uphold the creative vision while respecting the rights of all parties involved.I look forward to discussing this proposal further and collaborating with a skilled legal professional who shares my passion for storytelling and commitment to ethical representation.Budget: $50Posted On: February 22, 2024 11:04 UTCCategory: Intellectual Property LawSkills:Copyright Prosecution, Legal, Art & Design, Media & Entertainment, Copyright, Intellectual Property LawSkills: Copyright Prosecution, Legal, Art & Design, Media & Entertainment, Copyright, Intellectual Property LawLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered proposal, legal, advice-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Just to name a few; constant black-outs which of course affected fridges and freezes on a constant basis and sometimes for days, food shortages, water rations, curfews which meant we couldn’t get to the markets and more.My goal with this workshops is to introduce ideas of different methods in regards to food storage that are not so familiar to the average Australian. Our grandparents were true everyday “preppers” as they canned/ dried and preserved all the produce that they grew. They knew the necessity to harvest and preserve what they grew to keep them through the year. With this presentation I would like to introduce a couple of alternative methods of preserving food.The methods that I personally have adopted to preserve food are dehydrating and mylar bag storage.dehydrating foods is a safe and nutrient-efficient way of preserving food that can be kept on the shelf for many years if stored in the right container.mylar bag storage which enables food to be stored for 10 – 15 years safely.These two methods are simple, uncomplicated and relatively inexpensive ways of storing and preserving food for an extended period of time.Other subjects that we can touch on if time allows is:water / filtrations/ tanksmedicationsredundancies (items that will become scarce)seedsWhat to do in SHTF emergenciesvaluables and important papers securedcooking alternativesLightinggeneratorsDuration of a workshop: 2 hours (potentially longer)Cost: $20.

In this study, you will evaluate the quality of explanations generated by machine learning models that justify their decision on specific tasks of author attribution. The task consists of two phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2. In the following, we will explain each.Note: Because a portion of the data comes from social media posts, it is possible that you come across potentially distressing content or ideas. However, this content might not be extreme and can be found in public social media. By accepting to perform this task, you agree to participate in this study; you have the right to stop annotating at any time.In both phases, you will solve 70 tasks, each taking between 15 and 20 minutes.Phase 1:This phase consists of solving two types of tasks that we explain below (Task 1 and Task 2). You will be solving 50 tasks in total; each task is expected to take a maximum of 20 minutes to complete.Task 1:Task context. Law enforcement has identified a forum post we call a Query document (Q document). An investigation has resolved the origin of the post to a particular device such that it must have been written by one of the four potential authors: A, B, C, or D. Law enforcement need to know if there is evidence to support identifying one of the suspects for further investigation.Task description. Your task is to read the Query document as well as the posts from each author and determine which of the candidate authors is likely to have written the Query documents. In some of these tasks, you will also be given extra explanations of the linguistic, stylistic, and/or semantic features of the Query document, as well as posts from each author.Then, only if this information is given, you will have to answer a set of questions on the quality of explanations.Task 2:Task context. Same as Task 1 contextTask description. This time, you will be presented with an AI agent’s prediction of the Query document's author and the machine-generated explanation that justifies this prediction. Your task is to judge different aspects of the explanation you just saw with respect to the prediction.Annotation PlatformOn the annotation platform, click on the “Author Attribution Explanation” project. You will then be prompted with a summary of the instructions, and then you can start the evaluation. The total 50 tasks are composed of 10 sets of 5 tasks each, sequentially presented to you. Each set consists of the same Query and Author documents. The first task in the set consists of you solving the Type 1 task without any provided explanations. The second and third tasks in the set consist of you solving the Type 1 task but with explanations provided by two systems (describing the documents’ writing style and the overall similarity). The fourth and fifth tasks are of Type 2, where we additionally show the AI agent prediction by the two systems, and you have to answer questions regarding the prediction.Noe: More details on this Phase can be found in the Phase 1 Study Instruction and Info Sheet in the attachments.Phase 2:For each task, you will be presented with a query document and four candidate documents, along with the AI’s prediction of the author of the query document with explanations of the decision. Then, you will reason about the AI’s prediction on a follow-up document. You are to guess what the AI would predict. In total, you will solve 20 tasks.Note that your task is NOT to annotate the correct answers to the follow-up questions but rather guess the Robot's answers based on its explanation and answer in the starter text.Budget: $500Posted On: February 13, 2024 18:12 UTCCategory: Experimentation & TestingSkills:Content Writing, Linguistics, Writing, Natural Language ProcessingSkills: Content Writing, Linguistics, Writing, Natural Language ProcessingLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered introductionauthor, attribution, the-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

We have a cabinet maker, we have a match on our existing cabinets, and we know what types of cabinets we want to include... but the dimensions are tricky and we really want this to look seamless/like the entire kitchen was planned and installed together. I need someone with an eye for design and knowledge of kitchens/cabinets to help me decide on depths for the new cabinets so it looks best.Here are the details:The current run of cabinets are 12\" deep uppers and 24\" deep lowers. We're trying to add a set of 12\" deep toppers-- that's the easy part. Then, we want to add a floor-to-ceiling pantry to the right of the existing run, followed by three lowers (topped with a piece of matching remnant countertop), and ending in a second floor-to-ceiling pantry. The idea here is to create a built-in-buffet look, as the extension will run through the breakfast nook.Challenge #1 is that the perpendicular wall at the end of the cabinet wall (where the cabinets will end) has two wide windows, the first starting only 22\" inches from the cabinet wall (with the window sill only 21\" from the cabinet wall). So 24\" depth on the cabinets is problematic: at the very least, the second pantry has to be no more than 20\" deep, but do I match the new lower cabinets to that depth, too? And the first pantry?Problem #2, coming from the other side, is that obviously there's a big difference in depth of the upper and lower existing cabinets (12\" and 24\"), so by matching either of those depths, either the top or bottom half of the pantry is going to be 12\" out from or behind existing cabinetry.So: how deep do we make the pantries and the new lower cabinets? Do we \"bookend\" the existing run with a 24\" deep pantry? This would match the depth of the oven/microwave cabinet on the far left. Then would I step back the new lower cabinets and second pantry? Or just the second pantry?Or do we step back both new pantries so they're twins on either side of the new lower cabinets for a symmetrical buffet? And then how far do we step back? 12\", 18\", 20\"?Attaching photos of the existing kitchen and a mock-up of the new one from the cabinet maker. Ignore the width of the lower cabinets between the pantries-- we're swapping the two 36\" for three 24\".Budget: $65Posted On: February 14, 2024 15:31 UTCCategory: Interior DesignSkills:Architectural Design, Interior Design, Residential Design, 3D Modeling, 3D DesignSkills: Architectural Design, Interior Design, Residential Design, 3D Modeling, 3D DesignLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered need, help, deciding-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

We can add in a CTA, some client quotes.They are around leadership/people/team issues in the industry and are intended for senior VPS and Directors, L&D Directors.The other piece is called 'manager to leader' in pharma - I already have this piece but it's about reviewing and updating them. So it's more for middle managers.I have got a lot of biopharma industry experience, and I am a coach so what would work for me is if we can spend maybe 1 hour on a call, and I can download my thoughts, and then you do some research and add in additional information, we can finalise the two pieces on another call.You will know that the industry is constantly changing, is complex and highly-regulated and currently in the industry especially in Europe there is almost a 'war' for talent.M tone of voice is dynamic, positive, inclusive but straightforward - no fluff.

The application integrates Bing News and Search API, as well as the OpenAI API, to enhance user input queries. The primary objective of this web application is to provide users with immediate answers to their queries through news and web search. The application consists of three main components, all of which utilize both the OpenAI and Bing APIs.Current challenges:Our current challenge is that the application code is not optimized, contains many unused libraries,and the code not the best which results in a larger Docker image. This issue hinders our ability to deploy our API on AWS Lambda functions.ObjectiveThe main goal is to rewrite the application code from scratch for optimization & enhancement, develop an API for the existing functions using FastAPI, and deploy the optimized application on AWS Lambda functions. This will ensure that the application is efficient, scalable, and meets the deployment requirements of AWS Lambda.Scope of Work1. Code Analysis• Objective: Study and understand the current codebase to extract the necessary logic and functionalities.• Tasks:• Review the existing web app's codebase.• Identify key functionalities, algorithms, and logic used in the application.• Document the core components and their interactions.2. Code Rewrite• Objective: Rewrite the application code from scratch using the documented logic and functionalities as a reference, ensuring optimization and efficiency.• Tasks:• Develop a clean, optimized codebase using Python, focusing on minimizing dependencies and removing unused libraries.• Ensure the new codebase adheres to best practices for scalability, maintainability, and performance.• Incorporate Bing News and Search API and OpenAI API integrations as per the existing logic.3. FastAPI Development• Objective: Develop a FastAPI-based API for all the application functions to facilitate easy integration and scalability.• Tasks:• Design and implement API endpoints for each functionality of the web app.• Ensure comprehensive API documentation for ease of use and integration.• Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure API access.4. Deployment on AWS Lambda• Objective: Deploy the optimized application on AWS Lambda functions, ensuring that the deployment is efficient and the application is scalable.• Tasks:• Containerize the FastAPI application using Docker, ensuring the Docker image is optimized for size and performance.• Set up the AWS Lambda environment and configure it to host the Docker container.• Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment of the application.Deliverables• A fully rewritten and optimized codebase for the AI News Analysis web app.• A fully functional FastAPI API for the web app's functionalities.• Documentation covering the API endpoints, usage, and integration guide.• A deployed and functional version of the application on AWS Lambda.Project TimelineThe project is expected to be completed within TWO WEEKS, from the commencement date. A detailed timeline will be provided upon project initiation, outlining key milestones and deadlines.ConclusionThis project aims to significantly improve the performance, scalability, and deployment capabilities of the AI News Analysis web app. By rewriting the application code from scratch, developing a FastAPI API, and deploying the application on AWS Lambda, we aim to provide a robust solution that meets the immediate and future needs of our users.Budget: $350Posted On: February 18, 2024 14:54 UTCCategory: Generative AI ModelingSkills:LLM Prompt Engineering, Generative AI, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Python, Software Development, API, Database, Software Architecture & Design, Web DevelopmentSkills: LLM Prompt Engineering, Generative AI, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Python, Software Development, API, Database, Software Architecture & Design, Web DevelopmentCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered python, api-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.
