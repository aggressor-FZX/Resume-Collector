A third blueprint to handle orders from eBay.Make.com doesn't appear have an eBay integration (that I'm aware of), so that will either have to be via the eBay API, or perhaps as simple as email scraping from the Google Workspace Gmail account. I'm open to your suggestions re eBay!Some Etsy and Shopify automation experience will be a real bonus here as I'm sure there'll be some idiosyncrasies with the existing Modules!Each order may require multiple processes to collect the necessary information. For example, in the Etsy module the buyer name and address isn't included when watching for new transactions, so presumably we need an additional step to go off and get secondary data.There will also be various data manipulations required, for example the JSON may contain arrays for multiple line items or variations, and these will need to be handled appropriately (multiple rows in the spreadsheet for multiple line items)If I find the right partner here then I'm sure we can expand on the above over the comings months. For example, I'd love to see orders marked as shipped and tracking information uploaded when the Google Sheet is updated, but that can be phase 2!I'll break down the job into 3 milestones described above, and I'm looking for an idea of how many hours (approximately) you'll think each milestone will take.Thanks in advance, I look forward to reading your proposal.Hourly Range: $10.00-$40.00Posted On: February 18, 2024 16:14 UTCCategory: Scripting & AutomationSkills:Automation, Make.com, Data ExtractionSkills: Automation, Make.com, Data ExtractionCountry: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Built robust web-scraping and data-extraction pipelines using google, scraping, data extraction, automation, api, json, enabling reliable collection of structured datasets for analysis.

The most important thing is that the posts provide value to readers by clearly explaining key concepts, strategies, insights, or products in an easy-to-understand way.While I do want to utilize artificial intelligence tools to help make the writing process more efficient, it is crucial that the final posts sound like they were written by a human expert, not auto-generated by AI.The content should flow naturally, use simple but vivid language, and engage readers. I don't want the posts to come across as robotic or awkward, which can happen if AI is relied on too heavily. The writer will need a strong command of English and the ability to explain complex topics in a conversational way.If the first batch of 6 blog articles meets my quality standards, I anticipate there will be opportunity for an ongoing collaboration on future content. This initial contract is a chance for us to establish an effective workflow for producing high-quality blog posts leveraging AI tools appropriately without sacrificing the human touch needed to connect with readers. Please let me know if you are interested and have the required skills to successfully complete this type of technical writing project. I look forward to potentially working together!Posted On: February 15, 2024 21:28 UTCCategory: Article & Blog WritingSkills:Article, Business Writing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Content Writing, Article Writing, Technical Writing, Blog Writing, Blog ContentSkills: Article, Business Writing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Content Writing, Article Writing, Technical Writing, Blog Writing, Blog ContentCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered currently, seeking, experienced-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

A gen AI–powered tool can summarize key themes across the leases, such as how much rent is expected monthly or what market forces (such as local environmental, social, and governance compliance laws) could affect leases. Additionally, the tool can scan across leases for a particular parameter (for example, all leases with a rent price per square foot below a certain level) and generate tables of information.

Production-wise I am looking for something adjacent (but not limited) to the sounds of: The Weeknd, Brent Faiyaz, Joji, Ty Dolla $ign, Justin Timberlake, Frank Ocean, & Giveon.I am currently in the process of selecting my best work/demos and crafting them into original songs with quality producers. Many of my songs were written over 'type beats' and my vocal tracks are according to the BPM/key the type beat is set to. Everything else is fair-play, all melodies and songwriting is original, so we can transform these songs into polished, professional-sounding music.I have several songs written as piano compositions and several songs free-written (in-time/key but not transcribed). Regardless of which of the 3 options the demo is, the function will remain. I will provide you with my lead vocal track (and any accompanying stems if they are done and if they help) and you will construct the beat around it. I will provide guidance on my desires for the sound/emotion of the track in a concise document and include references to other songs that are in a similar pocket/style.ALL work must be original (sans any fair use policies) and free of copyright infringement. The completed instrumental must be usable by me as the appointed recording artist, used for-profit, and in accordance to my PRO (performance rights organization). You will retain 25% of the masters (the average rate for producers) and we can negotiate our split on publishing.If our first track goes well, we can work on future projects together as well, potentially even set up a bulk deal where I get 2-3 beats for a reduced price, under the same conditions. We can discuss more of this later. Please keep in mind that I am looking for someone very experienced with music and production who's wanting to work with artists that are prepared to take the next step. If you are still figuring things out with production and feel you need more time, you can always bookmark this post and reach out within the year (I will be active throughout), if it's meant to be it's meant to be. I do have an audio engineer but we can discuss the option of you completing the final mix for an additional price IF we feel this is best for the song.Thank you so much for your time and consideration, I know it was a lot to read but it is important that I am transparent about everything.

The goal is to enable retailers to seamlessly scan their in-store product barcodes using a Raspberry Pi or Arduino-based system. This system must then transmit the product data to a specified endpoint. The solution will be intricately integrated with our platform, [REDACTED_URL] facilitating retailers to list their products as part of a broader marketplace. Furthermore, this system will support online sales by generating a product feed through initial inventory synchronization.#### Key Features and Requirements:1. **Versatile Hardware Compatibility**: The hardware setup, utilizing Raspberry Pi or Arduino, must be adaptable to work with a wide range of barcode scanners, supporting various connection types (USB, serial, etc.). It should accommodate connections via both Ethernet and WiFi to ensure flexibility in different retail environments.2. **Intuitive Software Development**: Develop sophisticated software that not only reads and processes barcode data efficiently but also offers easy configuration options. The software should send processed data to a designated endpoint along with the retailer's store ID, and be capable of initial inventory alignment for creating an online sales-ready product feed.3. **Seamless Platform Integration**: The system should integrate flawlessly with [www.caleffionline.it]([REDACTED_URL] allowing for straightforward product listing and management by retailers. This includes automatic updates to the product listings on the platform based on the inventory scans.4. **User-Friendly Interface and Setup**: Emphasize creating a user-friendly interface for the initial setup and ongoing use. Retailers should find it straightforward to connect their hardware to both the internet (via Ethernet or WiFi) and our platform, with minimal technical assistance.5. **Simplified Product Insertion**: Enable retailers to easily add their products to the platform. This should include options for bulk uploads via xls or csv files with field mapping capabilities, or through an automated inventory reading mode using the system itself, making the process as efficient as possible.6. **Security, Privacy, and Documentation**: Implement top-tier security measures to safeguard retailer data and ensure compliance with privacy standards. Additionally, provide comprehensive documentation and support for system setup, use, and troubleshooting, including updates.#### Ideal Candidate(s):- Demonstrated experience with Raspberry Pi or Arduino, especially in developing compatible systems for diverse hardware interfaces- Advanced proficiency in software development for hardware interfacing, with a focus on barcode scanners and network connectivity (Ethernet/WiFi)- A strong track record in web development, particularly with API integrations and creating user-friendly interfaces- Knowledge and experience with inventory management systems and bulk data handling, including xls/csv file processingPosted On: February 13, 2024 20:33 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:Web Application, API Integration, Desktop Application, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Embedded SystemSkills: Web Application, API Integration, Desktop Application, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Embedded SystemCountry: Italy\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered google, api, csv-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.

Some elements are adopted directly from the Oregon flag design, while the majority are emblems of our business.We are making a 15 year anniversary design, with the our version of the beaver on the pocket area of the shirt and the emblem on the back. It will be screen-printed on, a one-color print._______________________________More Details/Specific Requests: [See attached brief file for full context]Beaver: [See in files]The beaver just needs a vector made of it as well as any print-ready file. The EW logo in the handle of the Beaver’s shovel is our company’s logo.Emblem: [See in files]All items adopted from the Oregon flag design need to be double checked for accuracy. There is a Vector file of the emblem available online or in attached files.Items from the Oregon Flag:Emblem: double check shape and thicknessStars: double check size, placement of the top two stars and the bottom one star need to be the same as the flag. The spacing between the 15 stars needs to be universal/the same.Bird: double check accuracy, we have not modified the bird or the wheat in its left hand. We HAVE modified the “arrows” in the right hand to tools that we use [see next section].Mt Hood: From the original design, slightly modified to add emptiness. Double check shape of mountain and peak is accurate, it’s what gives Mt Hood its name.Sun: The sun has been moved from the placement on the Oregon flag to the top of the center. Please recreate the sun and its rays to match the OR flag style, but keep sun in current location.Trees: The trees on the felt have been moved from the right side of the Oregon emblem and duplicated to fill space. Double check the moved trees for accuracy and add more to fill it out as it shows in our design.Banner with “Job Done Right”: Banner should be accurate; the slogan is our own.“Environmental Works” text and “2009” are in the style of Oregon flag, we have changed the scale to make the full company name fit and decreased the size of the date. Please just recreate from the design.___Items not from the flag were made by me, to represent our business and what we offer. Some of them I want to remain the same, most I want modifications or artistic updates for.Items from our business/made by me:Bird’s items: Spade, pipe wrench, wrench. Keep as is, unless you can make the three read better. The arrows on the original are small, so we need to stick to that scale.Columbia River: A simple design that “passes under” the banner. Keep island in the center and feel free to make modifications that would represent the Columbia River more accurately, or leave as is.Excavator: Please redraw to fit the style and to add some perspective. I like the bucket style but the body needs a professional touch.Shovel and dig site: Redraw if needed. Keep the soil mounds visible in some way, it connects the excavator, Heating Oil Tank, and dump truck all together.Heating Oil Tank: Move if need be, keep design as is.Dump Truck: Redraw. I like the style generally, but I think an expert could finish it better.Radon System (with house): Modify house if needed, keep Radon System fan as designed.Wrench: Feel free to redrawHard Hat: Please redraw. I like the scale but my art is not the best.Mostly I just want a re-finishing of the emblem that I’ve sent over. Our team knew it’d be a packed design so we wanted to get all of the brainstorming out of the way and focus on beautifying the output.If you want to make creative modifications, please chat with me about them!

It is important to note that the network request isn't stalled every single time (around 60-70% I would estimate get stalled), and using a regular browser (without CDP connection) and clicking the button manually results in the same intermittent problem.I have researched a bit regarding this, and found that there is a 6 port TCP limit imposed by chrome or something?
