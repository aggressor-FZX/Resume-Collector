So at this moment I would only want to know if the solution that I'm looking for is available and within budget.So I want to sell a table with the option of changing the tabletop design as well as the option to change the type of legs and than the color of those legs. Depending on the chosen variant of each. No this of course can be done with variable products in Woocommerce and that has worked fine for me as far as the price calculations and order process goes. But I also want the product image to reflect the right combination of options and colors. You could achieve this by setting a unique image for each of the possible variations, but with a lot of possible combinations (around 500 to 600 per table) this is no longer a workable option. So instead it would be great to have an option that let's me combine partially transparant layers of images for each variation option that get's combined in one image.I have the option to render images with a transparant background in WebP of all the \"components\", so for the separate table tops in different colors and finishes, and the legs, which are in available in different models and colors.One good thing to know is that the table top always needs to be in front of the image of the legs. So basically, there's always going to be a maximum of two images overlaying each other. First the legs, than the table top on top of that. And then depending on the selected model of the legs, and the color of the legs and table top, one of those images, or both of them need to change while keeping the tabletop image in front always.Although nice to have, It's not necessary to have the option to enlarge the product image or to let it pop-up in a lightbox or something like that.Posted On: February 19, 2024 11:37 UTCCategory: Ecommerce Website DevelopmentSkills:JavaScript, WooCommerce, CSSSkills: JavaScript, WooCommerce, CSSCountry: Netherlands\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered keep, mind, that-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

But I do have reference styles I am thinking for the project.Currently have 7-15 scenes created in basic stick figure storyboard form that need to be created.Likely start with one scene to see results before agreeing to bigger contract.

(Not looking to make 3D but if that is your skill and you have a good idea, I am open to it.)Over the background there will be limited animation looping for several minutes until the animation changes. Think turning book pages, someone in a chair bouncing their leg, rain dripping down window, etc. (Background stays the same).There will be 15 to 20 animation changes over the 20–30-minute looping animation/video. These have all been storyboarded by me.For level of animation on 2D background, think of a mix between Lofi animation and basic cartoon but more toward the Lofi style/complexity with minor animation movement.Videos will be shown on social media, streaming services, and other mediums for you to reference as your work.Happy to give credit to artists work when feasible, per each streaming service capability to do so.Important Details:All work will be the sole owner of the hiring company.

I have a few designs in mind and would require that you be willing to consult with me on those design ideas and/or offer other options. Its important, but not imperative, that you have an understanding of the roofing industry - \"fluff\" isn't required. But I want to stand out from other competitors, too.Most critical is that the finalized logo is formatted and saved in a format that allows me to use it across digital formats (website, social media, email), printable (contracts, work statements etc) and could potentially be used to create advertising that can be put on our trucks, machinery etc.Good, swift communication is required and I need this logo created quickly (I think 1 -2 weeks). I would like to have time to share my thoughts and consult with you, have a meeting to determine best option and to finalize.

Thank you for taking your time to read throught the project discription.I am currently working on a Shopify webshop (still not online) from where I need a private Shopify app for an e-book universe hidden behind a monthly subscribtion.The books that will be added to the e-book universe will be small childrens stories with a length between 10-20 pages, from where I should be able to write the stories and publish them directly from the backend.I wish to be able to make the stories dynamic, which means that there should be input fields when I create the stories, which will be used by the customer to change names of the characters ect. - please see example below:Text from backend:This is a story about a [gender-input] named [name-input], who enjoys playing football with[pronoun-input] friends.The customer will from their account be able to define these inputs which will be used in the story.Text from customer view with defind input fields:This story is about a boy named Tim, who enjoys playing football with his friends.Furthermore, I need a feature from where I can stack pictures on top of each other as layers to also make these dynamic. This means, that based on what character the customer has active, the pictures will change.This feature is fairly simple, because it can be achieved by multiple layers of the same dimention with transparent backgrounds, stacked on top of each other.I do already have a prototype of the system, from where I can share videos. Furthermore, I have made a developer scope which will also be shared with potential freelancers.Please note that, before starting on the project, I need you to confirm that this app is possible to create. I have previously worked with freelancers who promise alot, but can't deliver, which is only a very bad experience, but also a waste of boths time.Looking forward to hear from you :-)Budget: $500Posted On: February 17, 2024 09:21 UTCCategory: Ecommerce Website DevelopmentSkills:Liquid, Ruby on Rails, Shopify, Shopify AppsSkills: Liquid, Ruby on Rails, Shopify, Shopify AppsCountry: Denmark\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hello, everyone, thank-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I need to build a website to showcase my work portfolio.I’m exploring creating my own marketing and advertising consulting company while being open to working for other companies.Platform: I’ve already purchased an annual subscription to Wix so I’d like to build the site on this platform if possible. I’ve also purchased my domain via Go Daddy so that would just need to be attached to the site once ready.My Website Target:• Potential employers: targeting technology companies and/or entertainment companies.• Potential consulting customers: targeting any company (from large enterprise to smaller medium businesses or later stage start-ups).Website Design: Should be modern and sophisticated with some creative flair (not cookie cutter).• This site should be reflective of my own professional brand. The key things that need to come across is that I’m a dynamic and innovative marketer with global experience across all parts of the marketing funnel which spans B2B and consumer on high visibility campaigns.• Colors and design should underscore, complement, and enhance, my brand. I’m primarily open but think the main color scheme should be black and white to avoid distracting from my work.• I’m open to other accents of color but think it might be best to first share my content and see holistically what makes sense in terms of color (if any in addition).Website Content:1) Homepage- only thumbnail images. Each will link to the following company web pages (the original hompage design I sent refers to each one of these listed below.2) AWS (2 Campaigns)• Curiosity Kid: Germany, France, Canada, and Japan (8 TV ads total)• AWS Power Players Social Campaign (2 executions)3) T-Mobile (4 Campaigns)• T-Mobile Customer Service Campaign: TV, Social, Digital, Web – goal showcase the integrated campaign and 360 market approach at launch. (1 TV Video, 1 Social, and the rest are digital animatics, static retail and web visuals).• T-Mobile 55+ Campaign• T-Mobile: Military• Podcast/ The Restless Ones: Visuals (web, social, integrations) and audio links. Integrated marketing campaign.4) L’Oréal (2 Campaigns)• Keith Haring Holiday Collaboration: social and digital images. (all imagery no video)• Smart Profile project page- (all imagery no video)5) About Me (brief bio and resume highlights and key accomplishments).6) Articles/Blogs pageWebsite examples that I like: Open to others….• [REDACTED_URL] [REDACTED_URL] I like the use of the side navigation bar here. It’s clever, fun, and different. Although, it may be more optimal on desktop vs. mobile in which case maybe not.
