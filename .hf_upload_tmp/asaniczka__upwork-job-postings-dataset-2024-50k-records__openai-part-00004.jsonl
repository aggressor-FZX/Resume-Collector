This incldues - writing format, style, level of detail as well as the tone to make the site successful and grow it in the search (Google) by focusing on organic traffic- I would take care of the website: make sure it's running fast without issues and is secured, and take care of spammy/toxic links over time- We would focus only on Ubuntu and nothing else so we can become superior topical authority on this one thing- We both would get earnings every month- Then, our ultimate goal is to sell the website at some point. This is a huge step since sites are selling for 30x of monthly earnings, so if site earns let's say 2K, we could sell the site for 60K and go split 50/50 (30K to you, 30K to me), we can also decide to keep it and maintain it if you wish.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Your responsibilities:- Have great English is a must.

We would follow it.- We would not post articles everyday. We would schedule them every 3 to 4 days. That's what Google loves I can say- We would make sure the content even though very technical and coding-related, we would give it human touch and make sure it pass the AI style of writing so that we don't get penalized (This is actually NEW thing that we never did till now, only starting with it now on my other sites as well). Actually it's the biggest thing that make the site either successful or not due to AI generated content- I will send you list of topics about Ubuntu that you have to filter out so that there is no overlap.

Video call walk through of setting up my local machine (Windows PC) to run Expo testing successfullySkills Required:- Someone who has experience upgrading Expo SDKs of React Native mobile apps- Someone who has experience running Expo Development and Go servers for mobile app testing on Windows PCs- Someone who is a good communicator and willing to walk me through everything via video call and screenshareWe'll use the latest production branch of the app since I know the repo is working correctly and I want to make this as smooth and easy as possible.My overall goal of the video call and learning how to do the above is to start making small development changes on my own and I need testing with Expo to be fully operational again.I don’t expect the video call to take longer than an hour or so as I’m very familiar with the code (I wrote the backend and guided frontend development), working with the repo, PowerShell commands, etc.Long term I’d really like to find someone that I can hire ad hoc for future app feature add-ons and routine maintenance!Looking forward to working with you, thank you!Budget: $125Posted On: February 19, 2024 07:53 UTCCategory: Mobile App DevelopmentSkills:Mobile App Testing, React Native, Smartphone, Android, iOS, Mobile App Development, Expo.io, iOS Development, Android App DevelopmentSkills: Mobile App Testing, React Native, Smartphone, Android, iOS, Mobile App Development, Expo.io, iOS Development, Android App DevelopmentLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hello, hired, development-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

You are not developing the complete game, just the setting up, specific snapshots, and display of the game. You are required to write a 'level' editor for a simple game called MysteryWorld. A level in MysteryWorld is a room made up from 10 x 10 grid. Each cell in the room is referred to by the row and column number (coordinate).Game Specifications• A room in MysteryWorld can be populated by two types of entities: inanimate and animate entities.• There are two kinds of inanimate entities: stones which are represented by 'S' and holes which are represented by an 'O'. Holes also have a depth in meters represented by a number between 0 and 20. Expectedly, inanimate do not move.• Each living entity has a measure of its health, represented using an integer value between 0 and 100 and all the living entities can move. There are three types of living entities: dragons represented by the symbol #, human beings represented by @; and monsters represented by a ' * ‘ character. Each human being has a name, the monsters have strength represented by a number between 0 and 5.• All the animate objects can move and their health is usually reduced when they move.• Animate entities wandering around the worldo Humans: The humans always move to the cell to on their right, provided that this cell is not occupied and that they are not at the edge of the room. Otherwise they move to unoccupied randomly chosen cell adjacent to their current position. Their health is reduced by one every time that they move.o A dragon moves to a cell that is randomly chosen from those cells that are unoccupied, and adjacent to its current position. The health of the dragon is very volatile and is reduced by a random number between 0 and 5 every time it moves.o Monsters: A monster moves as many cells as its strength at any direction (up, down, left or right) as long as the destination is free and the monster remains within the room. For instance, the monster in position (9,3) in with strength 5 can move to position (9,8) but it cannot move to (4,3) because the cell is occupied, the monster cannot move to any other cell because it will reach the end of the room. In the case that there are not possible movements, the monster will move to a random empty cell next to it. The health is reduced as many points as the strength. In the unlikely event that all the possible options are invalid, the entity will not move. Furthermore, the default movement of all the living entities is to a random adjacent cell. You will work only with the console application to test your implementation. Code needs to have at least 3 classes: 1. Entity class: This is an abstract class which will act as the parent (base) class to all the different entities (Holes, Stones, Humans…) of the game.2. Room class: This is the class that stores the positions of all the entities. It should ideally contain the Methods to add entities, display the room, display information etc.3. Main class: This is the main class that handles the game. The menu will be implemented here and you will need to add the call to the specific actions.Functional Requirements1) The program should be a console application. The user interacts with the program by typing instructions into the standard input, and the program gives output by writing to the standard output.When the program starts, it should display the initial state of the game, and a menu. The initial state of the game should contain 2 holes, 2 stones, 3 monsters, 3 humans, 2 dragons, placed randomly in the room, with the constraint that two entities cannot occupy the same position. In the initial state, the depth of the holes is a random number between 0 and 20, monsters will be allocated a random strength between 0 and 5 and the three humans will be: Harold, David and Clare. All the animate entities are 100% healthy.2) The initial menu should offer the following options:1. Display Room2. Move all the animated entities3. Display the entity state by coordinates4. Reset the room5. Finish3) If the user selects ‘1’ from the menu, the state of the game should be displayed as shown in Figure 14) If the user selects ‘2’ from the menu, all the living entities should be moved according to the rules specified earlier.5) If the user selects ‘3’ from the menu, they should be prompted to specify a row, and a column, and then the properties of the entity at that position (if there is one) should be displayed, the output might be as follows:Entity properties:Type: humanName: HaroldHealth: 47If there is no entity in that cell, then your program should output a suitable message.6) If the user selects ‘4’ from the menu, then the state of the board should be reinitialised, in the manner described in functional requirements.7) If the user selects ‘5’ from the menu, then the program should terminate.Budget: $45Posted On: February 19, 2024 12:29 UTCCategory: Video Game DevelopmentSkills:C++Skills: C++Country: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered you, need, develop-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I currently have a list of about 32 keywords that I am trying to target and I need you to use your preferred tool of choice to write a [REDACTED_PHONE] word entry for each of them. You need to instruct your tool of choice to write the articles in a way that mentions the target keyword as much as possible without compromising on the readability of the article.At the beginning and end of the article, it should also mention the company name that provides the service the article is about and link to its site. All in all, it's a very straightforward process, just automating the writing of content marketing articles. I was doing it myself but it's getting too cumbersome submitting several prompts to ChatGPT 4.0 for each article (as it can't write [REDACTED_PHONE] word articles in one-go, you have to break them into separate sections and them combine them afterwards).Please also make sure that the articles aren't written too generically. You want part of your prompt engineering to include the act of instructing it to write in a more human manner that will relate to the readers, otherwise it'll just end up writing the articles in a way that is now easily detectable as AI-generated content by most people.I've found that finding content relevant to the keyword online and copy-and-pasting/feeding it the information from those articles makes it so it doesn't give you the most generic information imaginable. You just tell it to then re-write it in a fashion that sounds more human and it will do a relatively good job of that. Then just have it insert the company in one of the paragraphs in the introduction and conclusion. The introduction needs to be subtle and relevant, I do not want the articles coming off as too \"salesy\".I am looking to pay $3 per finished article and will have probably another couple hundred keywords that I'll need to target in the near future. Assuming you can churn out a finished article every 10-15 minutes like I was doing, this job will be paying about $12-$18 an hour. Send your proposals my way if you are interested.Budget: $100Posted On: February 20, 2024 06:49 UTCCategory: Creative WritingSkills:Content Writing, Search Engine Optimization, Article Writing, English, Article, Blog Content, Writing, Blog Writing, SEO WritingSkills: Content Writing, Search Engine Optimization, Article Writing, English, Article, Blog Content, Writing, Blog Writing, SEO WritingCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered seeking, chatgpt, just-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

You can view the Figma here:[REDACTED_URL] the web app does: The web app as visualized in Figma is meant as a landing page for business partners who agreed to review a service that has been provided to them. They will be offered assistance in writing their review via an AI-Text-Assistant (AITA). If they opt for the assistant, they will be asked which areas of the service provided they liked best and want to see mentioned in the review. These can be selected. Then the AITA will compose the review (via Open AI API) and present the result on the next page. This result can be copied to the clipboard by the user, so it can be used when placing the actual review on Google or Proven Experts (a review portal).The Figma: The design in figma was done in a simple manner. No components have been defined, no Auto-Layout, etc. However, the web app is very simple and consits only of four pages / steps.Responsiveness: The current design is meant for a mobile view and we would like to stick to that design in desktop and tablet view by making it appear like a form. Example:[REDACTED_URL] the smartphone, the header and footer of the wordpress page will need to be hidden from view, so that only the web app becomes visible.On desktop and tablet, the web app will appear like a form of the wordpress page.The Open AI integration: We already have a successful integration in place via Gravity Forms and their Open AI plugin. This could be used if you can make it work with the design.If you chose to use the existing Gravity Forms integration, the main challenge seems to get the result from the Open AI query to show up in our properly designed \"page 3\" instead of the Gravity Forms notification page (this is how it works out of the box after clicking submit).If you do not want to use Gravity Forms, we could run our own python script (which we would provide you) or use a different plugin.Page 2 functionality: We will need to be able to add or remove the selectable options in the Wordpress backend. We may want to add \"Great customer support\" some time in the future or remove an option. The selectable boxes must either be flexibly arrange themselves a) in the lenght of each box according to text displayed and b) to minimize white space between boxes. Alternatively, we can also live with a different design option as long as it looks good.Page 3 functionality: In the Figma, the result shows in a scrollable text box. The user should be able to edit the text here, if he likes. The button \"Copy to Clipboard\" should do just that.General:- The web app should work on most of todays devices and browsers.- The \"form entries\" should be collected with the review generated AND with the review that was present when the user clicks \"Next\". This way we can analyze if the user modified the proposed text.Timeline: We would like to complete this project as soon as possible, preferably until the 23rd of February at the latest.Please do not send AI-generated project proposals :)Thank you and I am looking forward to e-meeting you.Hourly Range: $15.00-$30.00Posted On: February 17, 2024 08:01 UTCCategory: Front-End DevelopmentSkills:Web Application, WordPress, CSS, API, Gravity Forms, FigmaSkills: Web Application, WordPress, CSS, API, Gravity Forms, FigmaCountry: Germany\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered google, python, api-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

The problems with this model is it leaves our competitors with no control over their product quality, pricing, customer support, expansion and more.Oasis On Location on the other hand is a completely centralized platform. We source all of the locations on our platform directly from short term hosts leaving us the ability to offer universal customer support, higher quality control, pricing control, and several other unique abilities.To add to this we are currently developing an AI integration that will allow production companies to upload their whole script. From there the AI will decode the script of all the locations and how they are described and link it to our massive portfolio to automatically source options from each scene in the script. Once this is complete this innovation will make us by far the most versatile and functional location rental platform currently on the market.Another massive advantage we have over our competition is full control over our expansion. We partner with top rental companies and acquire hundreds or even thousands of properties at a time. Since the start of 2024 we have brought on over 7,000 Film Locations, 4,000+ Yachts, and 2,000+ Cars, from the outreach force of just one agent.Our goal is simple. We want to be the largest location rental company in the world and with our strategy we are around [REDACTED_PHONE] good connections away from doing that.To achieve our goal we are looking to build a team of highly effective and motivated sales professionals to perform to key tasks in the company:POSITION 1 - New Location Outreach: This may possibly be the easiest sales job ever… or at least the easiest thing I’ve ever sold by far. Our service has no upfront cost, the short term host has the ability to accept or dismiss any booking and once they say yes we list all their spaces for them. Simply put, there is no way for an owner to lose money or time, there is only something to gain. With this offer I have historically received a 15%-25% positive response rate on cold outreach… meaning 1-3 people out of 10 don’t just respond but they respond with a positive go ahead to use the location or locations for film. Another key point is since the offer is so non-invasive and beneficial, if the owner has several properties or even thousands we can usually acquire all of them at once.Compensation: We have three compensation levels for agents that source new properties1 - 99 Locations = 30% of all profits from the locations for life[REDACTED_PHONE] Locations = 40% of all profits from the locations for life1000+ Locations = 50% of all profits from the locations for lifePOSITION 2 - New Member Outreach: The second key position needed is outreach agents to find new production companies and location scouts to use our services. This requires a simple outreach explaining the service and that we offer FREE location sourcing. From there the goal is to get them to create a FREE account on our site and start booking rentals.Compensation: As payment for finding new members the responsible Oasis Agent will receive a lifetime 10% commission on the profits from any rental said production company ever books through the Oasis On Location platform.We have designed our compensation structure to be very lucrative for building significant long term passive income for an elite select few. BOTH POSITIONS ARE COMMISSION ONLY + BENEFITS.Since the conversation rates of our offer are so high we do not need a massive team to complete the goal. We are looking for 2-3 new location outreach agents and 2-3 new member outreach agents to become long term valued partners in the company.This job allows you to pick your own hours and work from any location. There is no mandatory minimum number of hours worked per month, however we are looking for individuals who are motivated and committed to achieving our ultimate goal.Check Us Out At: Oasisonlocation.comLooking forward to hearing back from all interested parties!Hourly Range: $30.00-$80.00Posted On: February 17, 2024 07:59 UTCCategory: Sales & Business DevelopmentSkills:Sales, Lead Generation, Marketing StrategySkills: Sales, Lead Generation, Marketing StrategyCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hello, names, chase-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Also check if its possible to allow editing the email address's local-part in Roundcube natively.1) The plugin's default reply setting is to write from the custom email address but not the regular identity. Although this can be switched in the plugin's settings, it does not work for a multi-user setup of webhosting companies as some clients wish to reply from the custom email address which is the current default setting while others want to reply from their regular identity/address. This means, there needs to be a toggle in Roundcube's settings to choose one or the other option.→ Can this option be added to Roundcube's UI settings when adding the plugin?→ An even better solution may be to integrate half of the functionality in Roundcube natively by making the local-part of the email address editable. A toggle option in the settings shall determine to either always reply with the default identity or with the custom local-part the email was sent to before is got forwarded to the mailbox (as long as the domain-part is the same. Otherwise, it would require the custom_from plugin for a totally virtual alias). This saves setting up several identities for each custom email address the user receives emails to.The benefit is to communicate with each service provider by an individual email address so when the personal email address is leaked, it can easily be blocked by filtering as the main mailbox remains unknown which is a great spam protection.2) The plugin loses the modified email address and switched back to the user's default identity when saving a draft, closing the editing window and reopening the draft.→ Can this be fixed?You would need to set up a Roundcube installation and test the changes before creating a pull request on GitHub.Also modify the plugin's (and i.a. Roundcube's) ReadMe instructions accordingly and include sample pictures so that people have a visual impression of the functionality.As this will not only help myself but become public domain, it is a voluntary job that I'm happy to kick-start with a small budget.Send me a proposal when you wanna fight spam and consider the above useful and yourself skilled for the job.Posted On: February 14, 2024 09:25 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:PHP, JavaScript, CSSSkills: PHP, JavaScript, CSSCountry: Germany\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered improve, and, fix-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
