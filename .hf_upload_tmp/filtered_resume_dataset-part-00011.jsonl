It goes without saying that the ideal candidate will also bring knowledge of the plugins described above with him/her.Ideally, I find a person that can support me long term on a as needed basis. So far it has just been me setting up the websites and maintaining all of them. I moved NTLS.co in 2020 from Joomla to Wordpress. I studied IT in Germany but am not a programmer and need help from somebody that is.

People pay for a Gold or Silver membership (monthly or annually). That is one group. Another Group is Practitioners. Which people get assigned to when they complete a certain set of courses that we offer. The people in the directory on the page above are all Gold OR Silver members AND also Practitioner Members.I had paid a developer (the Joomla guy) before who created a custom code for me that does this for the directory itself. The shortcode we use is:[pmpro_member_directory_levels_combination formula=\"3|4|5|11&9\" levels=\"3,4,5,11\" layout=\"4col\" limit=\"75\" show_level=\"false\" show_startdate=\"false\" show_email=\"false\" order_by=\"mu.startdate\" order=\"ASC\" show_map=\"false\" fields=\"Trainer,hbmTrainerLevel;Pratitioner,hbmPractitionerRanking;Country,pmpro_bcountry;Tribe,company;My,website;\"]The levels are as follows:3 Gold Monthly4 Gold Annually5 Silver Annually11 Silver Monthly&9 PractitionerSo a user should be displayed if he is a Practitioner (9) and any of the other 4 memberships.It works well for the directory listing, but he couldn't figure out how to implement it for the Map. Currently I think all 3,4,5,11 level members are read out onto the Map. That is the part I need to get adapted.There are other directory pages that are set up exactly the same way, just that the Practitioner level ID (9 above) is a different value. E.g. on this page: [REDACTED_URL] the extra Level would 8 which is a certain type of trainer rather than 9 the Practitioner.PMPro support told me that what I want to do is possible with “hook into the pmpro_membership_maps_sql filter and add in additional SQL.” This is past my ability. k------Setting up Cache plug inThe site health plugin currently states that Page cache is not detected and the server response time is slowI had previously attempted to set Cache up but am not really familiar with how and what I need to do.
