I need to build a website to showcase my work portfolio.I’m exploring creating my own marketing and advertising consulting company while being open to working for other companies.Platform: I’ve already purchased an annual subscription to Wix so I’d like to build the site on this platform if possible. I’ve also purchased my domain via Go Daddy so that would just need to be attached to the site once ready.My Website Target:• Potential employers: targeting technology companies and/or entertainment companies.• Potential consulting customers: targeting any company (from large enterprise to smaller medium businesses or later stage start-ups).Website Design: Should be modern and sophisticated with some creative flair (not cookie cutter).• This site should be reflective of my own professional brand. The key things that need to come across is that I’m a dynamic and innovative marketer with global experience across all parts of the marketing funnel which spans B2B and consumer on high visibility campaigns.• Colors and design should underscore, complement, and enhance, my brand. I’m primarily open but think the main color scheme should be black and white to avoid distracting from my work.• I’m open to other accents of color but think it might be best to first share my content and see holistically what makes sense in terms of color (if any in addition).Website Content:1) Homepage- only thumbnail images. Each will link to the following company web pages (the original hompage design I sent refers to each one of these listed below.2) AWS (2 Campaigns)• Curiosity Kid: Germany, France, Canada, and Japan (8 TV ads total)• AWS Power Players Social Campaign (2 executions)3) T-Mobile (4 Campaigns)• T-Mobile Customer Service Campaign: TV, Social, Digital, Web – goal showcase the integrated campaign and 360 market approach at launch. (1 TV Video, 1 Social, and the rest are digital animatics, static retail and web visuals).• T-Mobile 55+ Campaign• T-Mobile: Military• Podcast/ The Restless Ones: Visuals (web, social, integrations) and audio links.

(all imagery no video)• Smart Profile project page- (all imagery no video)5) About Me (brief bio and resume highlights and key accomplishments).6) Articles/Blogs pageWebsite examples that I like: Open to others….• [REDACTED_URL] [REDACTED_URL] I like the use of the side navigation bar here.

Our microsites are built with Sinatra or Jekyll with Shopify as the checkout, so familiarity with SEO on these platforms is a plus.• Advisement on SEO best practices within the context of evolving AI technologies and how we can lay the groundwork for future developments.What You Bring to the Table• Proven experience with SEO, particularly with programmatic SEO and understanding the nuances of ranking microsites.• Ability to communicate complex SEO concepts in layman's terms and provide actionable insights.• A strategic mind that can help us prioritize SEO efforts effectively, considering our limited resources.• Availability for at least two 1 hour phone calls a month to discuss and refine SEO strategies.Our End GoalWe want to build a long-term working relationship similar to the successful one we have with our PPC expert—collaborative, insightful, and profitable.Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to working with you.Posted On: February 22, 2024 21:40 UTCCategory: SEOSkills:Search Engine Optimization, SEO AuditSkills: Search Engine Optimization, SEO Audit\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

For some months we will have all of these blocks, for others we might only have two blocks. As such we require a template that will allow us to pick and choose which blocks we would like to use for a given month.The title, copy and links of each block will of course change each week, so we need the ability to go in and edit these elements, whilst still keeping the block styling.For each block, we would then need the ability to select different variables. Variable requirements are:No FillFillOutlineFor Fill and Outline, we then need the ability to select colour variables (pink or orange). Mock ups of these have been supplied in the design fill.We also need the ability to add buttons to each block. Similar to the above, we require the buttons to be either Fill or Outline. With the ability to select Pink or Orange.There will also be occasions where we do not use a button, but use a hyperlink instead.

If any further clarity is needed, or further design mock-ups are needed, please let me know.We need an easy-to-use template that can facilitate all of the above.Question - You’ll notice that within our block titles, we have used emojis. What is the easiest way to use these within HTML?More detailed requirements are listed below.Please review, and raise any concerns prior to the project starting.- We require the ability to date individual emails- The typeface used throughout is Matter SQ which we can provide- All instances of links/hyperlinks to open in a new tab- The body of the email must be thinner than a typical webpage to support long form text.

{"content": "Delivered solo, entrepreneur, with-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"I am a solo entrepreneur with experience managing software projects. I want to create a cross-platform iOS and Android alarm app with a special method of disabling the alarm: facial expression recognition. The alarm functions would be very simple, similar to the built-in alarm functions of each mobile OS clock app. But instead of a button to turn off the alarm, the user will be prompted to make a specific facial expression. The alarm will only disable when the front-facing camera detects the specified facial expression, for example a smile, or a frown.This alarm app is similar to a reference application that no longer works on modern devices. You can see a description and example images here: [REDACTED_URL] here:[REDACTED_URL] that this previous app is only used for reference. The concept of using face recognition to disable an alarm is not patented, copyrighted, or trademarked, and no infringement of intellectual property is intended or allowed in the development of this app.I believe that both iOS and Android include local, on-device facial recognition libraries that should be able to perform the required face recognition and identify simple expressions such as \"frown\", \"smile\", etc. A full list of expressions for detection will be provided, but it should be no more than 5-6 total.The final additional capability of the app would be to capture an image of the user making the expression that disables the alarm each time it activates. The image would be saved to the user's Images or Downloads folder with a Caption showing the facial expression the user was prompted to make for that alarm activation instance. When the image is captured it is shown to the user and a Share function is available within the app to immediately share the captured image to the OS-provided share destinations, e.g. social media apps, etc.An outline of the desired features is shown in bullet points attached here as an image, along with some example images of the app linked to above for reference.Please note: if development is significantly easier and/or cheaper on one platform or the other, iOS or Android, and much harder or more expensive cross-platform, I will consider focusing only on the easier platform for an initial application. But I would prefer cross-platform. I am an Android user so that would be most easy for me to test, but I have access to Mac devoices for testing in a dev environment (I do not have an iOS device at this time).There are additional features to implement in future versions of the app, so a successful developer will have potential future work as well.

It is a deck of cards that updates traditional tarot with contemporary Millennial humor and wisdom. For example, the original tarot “The Devil” is \"The F&ckBoy\", “The Hermit” is renamed as “Off-The-Grid”, and “The Chariot” is “Van Life”. We've sold out twice, and now we're creating a much requested Gen Z version. I'm a Millennial, however, and need help coming up with the funny terms and writing the descriptions for a Gen Z themed deck.For those unfamiliar with tarot, people think of it as a fortune-telling tool or cards for psychics, but millions of people use it as a tool to analyze what’s going on in their life and it's become very popular among Millennials and Gen Z. I try to make it way more approachable by making it funny and relatable Millennial humor, and I want to do the same with Gen Z humor but need help.Please feel free to explore the deck and artwork in the current Millennial deck here www.millennialtarot.com/cards.Role & Responsibilities:* You'll receive a spreadsheet detailing the traditional 78 tarot card names and meanings alongside the Millennial name and descriptions for reference.* Your task is to create a list of Gen Z-related slang, expressions, archetypes, and struggles that encapsulate the essence of each card that could be used as the Gen Z name for that card.Benefits:* Hourly pay.* If all goes well, opportunity for contract to write the guidebook, as well.* You'll work independently, on your own time and relatively at your own pace. You are welcome to use me as a resource to ask questions, but do not need to.* I think it's a fun activity and really enjoyed doing it for Millennial Tarot!Requirements:* Deep familiarity with Gen Z culture, including but not limited to memes, slang, expressions, archetypes, humor, and struggles.* Interest and knowledge in spirituality and tarot is a plus but not required.* Many, but not all, of the cards are funny, so a sense of humor is also a huge plus.Let me know if this is something that would interest you and you feel like you could do a good job at. If so, I may ask for a writing sample, or give you 3 or 4 cards to come up with equivalent Gen Z names for as a trial for the whole 78.

{"content": "Delivered have, keen, interest-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"I have a keen interest in interior design but never had the time to study it because of my work. However, with the little knowledge I have, I have been trying to design my rental apartments myself with the concept of wabi-sabi.The design is very minimal and aesthetic but all the necessary elements are still available. 60% of the design is complete need help with 40%.I have been using arches as my primary shape, and the furniture designs are low in height to give a feeling of high ceilings. The lighting consists of bamboo pendant lights and straw lights, but I feel the design still lacks something and doesn't feel complete. I am stuck with designing two bedrooms one with a queen-size bed and the other with a twin bed aswell. I have created some designs, but I am not completely satisfied with them as I feel it’s not cohesive and complete, and I'm having a hard time. I have three colors in mind: white, pine wood color, and brass color, with white being the main color (60%), pine wood being the secondary color (30%), and brass being the highlight color (10%).I am looking for someone who can improve the existing design so that all the interiors align with the arch shape and wabi sabi concept. I need sizes for the furniture, complete design for one queen bedroom and one twin bedroom, entrance reception, lighting , rendering and improvements for other rooms with necessary requirements. I have already purchased most of the items, and I can send pictures as well.Requirement and expectation:1. Alignment with Concept: Ensure that all interior designs align with the concept of wabi-sabi, focusing on simplicity, natural elements, and imperfection with the current design.2. Improvement of Existing Design: Enhance the current design to make it feel complete and cohesive. Address any perceived shortcomings and ensure that the design reflects the concept and vision accurately.3. Furniture Sizing: Provide specifications for the sizes of furniture pieces to ensure they fit well within the space and contribute to the desired aesthetic.4. Complete Bedroom Designs: Develop detailed designs for both the queen-size bedroom and the twin bedroom, considering factors such as layout, furniture placement, color scheme, and lighting.5. Color Scheme: Incorporate the specified color scheme of white (60%), pine wood (30%), and brass (10%) throughout the design, with white as the dominant color and brass used as accents.6. Utilization of Purchased Items: Work with the items you've already purchased to integrate them seamlessly into the design, ensuring they complement the overall aesthetic.7. Necessary Improvements: Identify and implement any necessary improvements or additions to other rooms, taking into account functional requirements and aesthetic preferences.8. Collaboration and Communication: Maintain open communication throughout the design process, considering your input and feedback to ensure the final result meets your expectations.9. Budget Considerations: Keep in mind that the apartment is leased, and therefore, expenses for permanent alterations should be minimized. Prioritize design elements and modifications that can be easily removed or reversed without significant cost or damage to the property. Focus on cost-effective solutions and utilize existing resources wherever possible to stay within budget constraints.Budget: $200Posted On: February 16, 2024 13:16 UTCCategory: Interior DesignSkills:Hotel Design, Interior Design, SketchUp, Residential Design, 3D Rendering, Commercial DesignSkills: Hotel Design, Interior Design, SketchUp, Residential Design, 3D Rendering, Commercial DesignCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

So I would like them re-created, digitally hand drawn if you will. The graphic can be just line art. It would have enough detail to love it and wear it. I would like to have the design embroidered, but too much color doesn't do well in embroidery (apparently).Someone rightly said, I am creating a Culture, a tribe, with these designs. These designs would capture the attention of 24yr - 45yr old's who love the casual attire and already purchase printed clothing. Visit the site, take in the designs already there. Create a story in your mind's eye, how does this topic (and attached files) resonate with you?Do you have an idea you want to talk to me about, let's talk.Is there a collaborative idea brewing in your mind, let's hear it.What I have in mind for the next collection - 'Clan' - which clan do you belong to. Running a business on a shoestring budget is no fun, and very limiting. I am looking for 1 design to start the new collection. If you have opened the attachments, then you might be able to visualize it. For each of the designs on my site, they each could be a character in an untold story. Each new design, would open the next chapter in the story.When I mentioned 'wear it', these designs will be printed/embroidered on t-shirts, hoodies and sweatshirts to begin with.Check this out:[REDACTED_URL] is a new business with which I want to deliver endless creativity. I welcome any questions you might have.What I need:1 concept design, similar to the attached filesFull res PNG, JPG, digitized embroidery file, transparent backgroundThose whom I shortlist, I will have a meeting with you online. I would like to see your portfolio's as well. I live in Melbourne, if that's you, let's catch up over coffee.I have worked with certain graphic designers repeatedly on touchups and fixes. You could be a part of that pool too. Tell me, show me, surprise me with you can do and I will come to you again.Looking forward to hearing from you.CheersSuneil Cchoiceculture.com.au | (IG) @choicecultureauBudget: $100Posted On: February 22, 2024 10:41 UTCCategory: Graphic DesignSkills:Adobe Illustrator, Graphic Design, Illustration, Adobe Photoshop, T-Shirt Design, Clothing, Drawing, Embroidery DigitizationSkills: Adobe Illustrator, Graphic Design, Illustration, Adobe Photoshop, T-Shirt Design, Clothing, Drawing, Embroidery DigitizationCountry: Australia\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}
