{"content": "Delivered got, myself, into-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"I've got myself into a mess from a business acquisition in 2022 that I need to clean up and I am looking for a CPA/Tax Attorney. Here's an overview. Let me know if you are interested and if so how to proceed.Background:I live in Salt Lake City Utah and I acquired on 3/29/22 a Chicago company. The firm is fully remote and I run it from Utah.The acquisition was a stock acquisition which was to be treated as an asset sale under a 336(3) election.Here is how the acquisition went down.PP, LLC (41.9% John Doe, 57.0% James Doe, 1.1% Jane Doe) Was formed on 3/3/2023 and took a minority ownership of the Praedium Valuation, LLC.PV, LLC (95% (ME), 5% PP, LLC) was also formed on 3/3/2023.Both PP, LLC and PV, LLC (Origally set up to be taxed as a partnership) then acquired PF Inc on 3/29/2022 as a stock acquisition agreement to do a 336(e) election to treat it as an asset sale.PF, Inc was formed in 2001 and was/is an S-Corp and had an existing EIN number.Issues:1) A partnership cannot own an S-Corp. I paid a lot of money to the fairly large M&A firm that has tax attorney specialists that worked on this transaction that missed this.A) How do I resolve?I) Can I retroactively dissolve PP, LLC or make me the only entity on it retroactivly so that as a single member owner of the LLC's we are good?II) Is their alternative options that would be better. John, James, Jane are all family and willing to do whatever is easiest.2) The 2022 & 2023 Taxes have not been filed. We had an extension for PF, Inc but I forgot to do one for PV, LLC. Therefore I see no path to take the 336(3) Election. I know how ridiculous this is and it's embarrassing.I) With 2022 Filing do I take the 336(E) Election? Maybe provide an explanation of circumstancesII) Do I just forget about the 336(E) and treat the sale as if it were a stock sale for filings?II) Any other alternatives or paths I should take?3) Retaining the EIN was important going into the transaction. It's part of the reason for the stock sale. Now not necessarily the case.A) Do I want to or need to retain the EIN fro PF, Inc.B) If retaining it do I keep it with PF, Inc or associate it with PV, LLCC) What actions do I need to take with IRS regarding the EIN4) This acquisition lost $1M (35%+) in annual revenue potential at closing based on information that was not made available to me going into the transaction. That in addition to real estate transaction volume dropping significantly with Interest rates rising dramatically the business is failing. There are three paths in consideration. Plan A: Chapter 11 Sub IV bankruptcy, Plan B: An Article 9 short sale, Plan C: Close business and personal bankruptcy. For now please assume Plan A Sub IV is the path as it's the most likely and the current path I'm walking. The business debt is personally guaranteed by just me and PV, LLC and PF, Inc are also both liable for the business debt. While PF, Inc is registered in IL and PV, LLC registered in Utah. Long term corporate will always be Utah. For bankruptcy filing I want to file in Utah.A) How do I make sure I can file Sub IV in utah?I) Do I need to make any entity changes to do so?I know this is a lot. The priority is to file taxes. I feel like 1-3 need to be resolved to do that. Bankruptcy filing is likely to occur in 60-120 days so 4 above is relevant information to aid in 1-3 but it's lessor of a priority.Thank you for your time!Hourly Range: $75.00-$335.00Posted On: February 15, 2024 23:38 UTCCategory: Tax LawSkills:Accounting, CPA, Tax Preparation, Tax Law, Corporate TaxSkills: Accounting, CPA, Tax Preparation, Tax Law, Corporate TaxLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

We are a beacon for those who dare to disrupt the fashion industry with audacity and creativity. Our brand is a celebration of the rebels, the thinkers, and the dreamers who see fashion as more than clothing—it's a form of expression, a stand against conformity, and a dialogue with society.Our Essence:We thrive on the edge of innovation and rebellion, where bold expressions and unconventional creativity collide to challenge fashion norms. \"Enfant Terrible\" is about making statements that resonate, provoke thought, and spark conversation. Our designs are not just worn; they're experienced.Objective:We're searching for a logo that is as impactful and rebellious as our brand. This includes a captivating mascot logo—a 20-year-old boxer with a story told through scars and a demeanor that speaks volumes—and a striking wordmark that captures our avant-garde ethos.Mascot Logo Detailed Vision:The mascot should be a symbol of defiance and resilience, depicted through expressive line art that captures the spirit of a young boxer ready to challenge the world. His scar under one eye and buzzcut should reflect a narrative of survival and fighting spirit. This mascot isn’t just for \"Enfant Terrible\"; it's for our community that stands against creative conformity.Wordmark:The wordmark should embody the essence of our brand—bold, artistic, and unapologetically avant-garde. It needs to complement the mascot yet be strong enough to stand on its own across our fashion lines and branding materials.Creative Liberty:In addition to the boxer concept, we invite you to propose a second mascot concept. This is your canvas to interpret \"Enfant Terrible\" in a way you see fit. Impress us with your creativity.Design Preferences:Style: The mascot should be realized in a cartoon style with not to much detail but still capturing emotion and narrative. The wordmark should be distinct and memorable, embodying the brand's avant-garde personality.Color Palette: We entrust you with the color palette. Draw from the brand's essence of rebellion and avant-garde artistry. We're looking for something that makes a statement but remains versatile across various applications.Application:This logo will be our standard-bearer, appearing everywhere from digital domains like our website and social media to the tangible world of our clothing and promotional materials. It must be versatile, scalable, and iconic.Budget and Timeline:Budget: Allocated 200 to 400 euros. We view this as an investment in a partnership to bring the essence of \"Enfant Terrible\" to visual life.Timeline: Your expertise is valuable to us.

We cannot estimate at this point which things still need to be done to avoid teething problems with the release of the webshop.This is why we need a developer especially for the correct setting up connecting our web shop with our ERP. You should bring in experience with what technical set-ups will be important for us since we are not educated enough to estimate and realize all aspects ourselves.We are planning to work on front end matters of this webshop ourselves, so there is no need for design experience.Just to make clear, it is crucial for us that you should bring in experience with Wordpress/Woocommerce, but especially JTL software. Since JTL is a German software provider it can be more difficult to familiarize oneself with this. We want to avoid working together with a partner that first has to figure out how JTL works.This project might be relatively compact and manageable since we are “only” talking about interfacing two systems.

So at this moment I would only want to know if the solution that I'm looking for is available and within budget.So I want to sell a table with the option of changing the tabletop design as well as the option to change the type of legs and than the color of those legs. Depending on the chosen variant of each. No this of course can be done with variable products in Woocommerce and that has worked fine for me as far as the price calculations and order process goes. But I also want the product image to reflect the right combination of options and colors. You could achieve this by setting a unique image for each of the possible variations, but with a lot of possible combinations (around 500 to 600 per table) this is no longer a workable option. So instead it would be great to have an option that let's me combine partially transparant layers of images for each variation option that get's combined in one image.I have the option to render images with a transparant background in WebP of all the \"components\", so for the separate table tops in different colors and finishes, and the legs, which are in available in different models and colors.One good thing to know is that the table top always needs to be in front of the image of the legs. So basically, there's always going to be a maximum of two images overlaying each other. First the legs, than the table top on top of that. And then depending on the selected model of the legs, and the color of the legs and table top, one of those images, or both of them need to change while keeping the tabletop image in front always.Although nice to have, It's not necessary to have the option to enlarge the product image or to let it pop-up in a lightbox or something like that.Posted On: February 19, 2024 11:37 UTCCategory: Ecommerce Website DevelopmentSkills:JavaScript, WooCommerce, CSSSkills: JavaScript, WooCommerce, CSSCountry: Netherlands\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

(Not looking to make 3D but if that is your skill and you have a good idea, I am open to it.)Over the background there will be limited animation looping for several minutes until the animation changes. Think turning book pages, someone in a chair bouncing their leg, rain dripping down window, etc. (Background stays the same).There will be 15 to 20 animation changes over the 20–30-minute looping animation/video. These have all been storyboarded by me.For level of animation on 2D background, think of a mix between Lofi animation and basic cartoon but more toward the Lofi style/complexity with minor animation movement.Videos will be shown on social media, streaming services, and other mediums for you to reference as your work.Happy to give credit to artists work when feasible, per each streaming service capability to do so.Important Details:All work will be the sole owner of the hiring company.
