Context: General tech role"},{"role":"user","content":"Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Part IOverview:In the first part of the final project, you will set up a complex scene by loading from two simple file formats—OBJ models accompanied by MTL material files. You will then apply lighting and texturing. When it is done, your scene will consist of a lit and colored car sitting on a lit and colored road next to a lit and textured stop sign, illuminated by a lit and colored streetlamp.Part 1-1: Setting your SceneThe first step is to review the starter code for this project. It contains a Model and a Face class and a series of calls that take in OBJ and MTL files and parses them into Model objects. Make sure you understand what this code is doing and what it returns so that you know how to use it in your program. You are welcome (but not required) to make any modifications to this code that you see fit. If you see any errors in this starter code or have any suggestions for improvement, let the instructor know.The starter code produces several console.log() statements that allow you to look at everything that has been processed from the files. You should study these statements to understand how the data in the Model class is organized. In particular, node how Model has an array of Face instances that contain all of the vertices, normals, and texture coordinates for each face in that model. The faces have all been triangulated for you, so you can just pass them directly into the vertex shader (either one face at a time or all at once) to draw your mesh using gl.TRIANGLES. Each face also has a corresponding material field that references one of the materials in the diffuseMap and specularMap fields in Model. You can use this information to look up the appropriate values for your lighting calculations on that face.Once you are comfortable with the above information, you should then render your models in a simple view to verify that your program is working. (HINT: Start with the stop sign, since it's the simplest mesh.) You will then want to set up your scene as shown in the demo video (you will incorporate the bunny in a later step). Once everything is set up correctly, you should then turn your attention to the MTL files.Diffuse colors in the form “Kd [R] [G] [B]”Specular colors in the form “Ks [R] [G] [B]”A diffuse texture map in the form “map_Kd [Map Image]”Part 1-2: LightingNext, you will place a point light at the top of your streetlamp to illuminate your scene. Your light should use Phong shading, and you should use the previously loaded diffuse and specular material colors from the MTL file. You may create your own ambient color.Allow the user to press the ‘L’ key to toggle the light on/off, but make sure that ambient light is still applied to your scene even when the light is off.Implementation Notes:Your lighting will likely look flat simply due to the normals on the provided models not being smoothed.Part 1-3: TexturingNext, you will implement texturing in your program using the texture coordinates loaded from the stop sign’s OBJ file, accompanied by the stop.png texture as specified in the map_Kd attribute of the material in stopsign.mtl.Implementation Notes:The texture coordinates in the OBJ file are flipped along the Y-axis; to get your final texture coordinates, you should subtract the V coordinates from 1.Part 1-4: Camera AnimationFinally, you will implement basic camera animation so that the user can view your scene from different angles. When the user presses the ‘C’ key, make the camera move along a circle on the XZ plane, while bobbing up and down slightly (along the Y-axis) as shown in the demo. (HINT: Think about how you might use the trigonometric functions.) The camera should not jump at all when the user starts or stops the animation and should preserve its current state.Part IIFinal Project Part II DemoLinks in starter fileOverview:In the second part of the final project, you will use a matrix stack to structure your scene through hierarchical transformations. You will also implement simple shadows, reflections, and refractions.Part 2-1: Hierarchical TransformationsPart 2-2: Hierarchical CameraPart 2-3: ShadowsPart 2-4: SkyboxPart 2-5: Reflections and Refractions (i.e. Environment Maps)Make bids and I will share more details and files also in chats.Happy Bidding!!!Budget: $80Posted On: February 20, 2024 18:16 UTCCategory: Video Game DevelopmentSkills:TypeScript, JavaScriptSkills: TypeScript, JavaScriptCountry: India\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered part, ioverview, the-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

We need to enhance this project to:1. Obtain a temporary, writable folder.2. Create an always-unique subfolder within that folder.3. Extract all files to that unique subfolder.4. Run the specified program found inside that unique subfolder.5. Wait for the launched program to finish running.6. Clean up all extracted temporary files and delete the temporary folder.7. Return the exit code that the invoked program in #5 returned (or, if extraction failed for any reason, return a custom non-zero numeric failure code).Details for #3 above:a. The archive being extracted may be password protected. In this scenario, you will either prompt for the password on the command line (or if being run silently [please see \"General Details\"/section iii below], accept the password as part of the specified \"/k\" password command line parameter).Details for #4 above:a: The program to run shall be specified as part of a text file appended to the end of the compiled binary, located immediately before the archive being appended to the end of the compiled binary.b. The program shall be sent all of the command line parameters that the self-extractor itself received while being launched.c. The program shall also be sent the full path to the self-extractor executable as part of the \"/m\" command line parameter, to be added to the existing command line it is being sent (if any).General Details:============i. The final binary must have no dependencies other than the existing dependencies already required by the current version of the p7zip project.ii. The final binary must be a command line only tool (no GUI whatsoever). Extraction progress (and any error messages) shall only be displayed on the command line. Any user input shall only be prompted on the command line.iii. The final binary must support 100% silent operation when the \"/s\" command line parameter is specified. It must complete all tasks absolutely silently and non-interactively (the invoked application itself may be non-silent, of course), with zero output to the command line while retaining 100% of the behavior above.iv. Support for any existing command line parameters available in SFXCon (which is similar to 7zip's own command line interface) are to be dropped.Schematic of a Built SFX:===================[your customized SFXCon binary] + [text file specifying name of program to launch] + [7zip archive to extract]You will use Linux system calls to determine the length of your compiled binary and start reading past it to locate the text file appended to it. The text file appended to it will contain a \"magic end of file marker\" past which the archive shall be found for extraction. Since the existing SFXCon project already extracts the archive appended to it, most of this code is already expected to be in place as part of the baseline p7zip project.Target Platforms:=============x86_64 and aarch64, native code, single source, universal Linux compatibilityBudget: $500Posted On: February 20, 2024 13:11 UTCCategory: Desktop Software DevelopmentSkills:Linux, C++, Desktop ApplicationSkills: Linux, C++, Desktop ApplicationCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered you, will, start-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I'm looking for an experienced UI/UX Designer who can review and enhance the design of my mobile app MVP. The goal of design should be to facilitate a streamlined user experience and a unique aesthetic. I want a design that's bold but sleek. A look that feels like the future... and that future exudes precision haha. I recognize that sounds crazy, but if you're the right person, I think you'll find that exciting! :)I value curious and driven partners, NOT order takers. I'm looking for someone who can ask the right questions, offer creative ideas/solutions, and use this MVP as an opportunity to be different, think outside the box and most of all have fun! I have a vision, but I'll lean on you to bring the UI / UX expertise. Your ideas, guidance, and thought leadership are very welcome here.As background, I recently quit corporate America cause it sucks and life is too short to do sucky things. I've spent my time learning new things and realized I enjoy turning ideas into apps... but I also realized that I'm not good at design, so that's where you come in haha. I'm hoping we can build a relationship to work together not just on this project, but into the future. Since this is just me working on a passion project, I don't have a huge budget. However, the app is just a few pages with a targeted mission, so it should be manageable.To summarize the design approach: As previously mentioned, bold, sleek, future and precise. The objective is to leave the user subconsciously thinking two things:1) Woah, cool design2) Everything is right where/when I need it. No confusion. No extra clicks. No fluff.If this feels like you, please let me know why. And if you have some examples, even better.Thanks for your time! :)*** INSERTING BORING AI GENERATED STUFF HERE ***Skills needed:- Mobile app design- User experience (UX) design- Graphic design- Figma- Adobe Creative Suite- Prototyping tools- Attention to detailHourly Range: $17.00-$50.00Posted On: February 16, 2024 00:45 UTCCategory: Mobile DesignSkills:iOS, Android, Mobile App Design, Hybrid App Development, Mobile UI Design, Figma, FlutterSkills: iOS, Android, Mobile App Design, Hybrid App Development, Mobile UI Design, Figma, FlutterCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hey, there, looking-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

The consumer should be able to drag and drop component from a panel and design the form needed on runtime.Other features that should be expected in this POC as functionalities:Ability to customize the breadcrumb configuration:- choose which separator icon- what to do when breadcrumb are large etc- basically all customization options available in ionicThe menu can have 3 layouts:- side menu- the side menu should have four states:- overlay (mobile / tablet)- fully closed (smaller side menu only with icons)- partially closed ( small side menu with icons and profile showing)- fully open- full page menu- header menu with drop downsThe edit / add pages related to the same module should have 2 possible ways to open:As a side modalAs a dialogThe standard sizes of the side modal and dialogs should be configurable:- alert dialogs / modal- confirmation dialogs / modal- business dialogs / modalThe styling of the panel / dialog should be configurable as wellUse NGRX for state management ( make the library based on a dynamic ngrx state management.)Dropdown menu to be configurable (styling wise)-------------------------------------------------------------N.B: these are some scratch ideas of what the POC should include.

I don't need a GUI on the RDS desktop though.I have already using Auto Hotkey made a simple script as proof of concept which uses Winset \"Always On Top\" to make the 3cx GUI sit on top of the RDS session so the GUI can be used by the user---F12::WinRestore, 3CXWinGetTitle, title, Atitle = RegExReplace, title,#redacted this for upwork compatibility, removes invalid characters#If $titlenew = \"3CX\"Winset, AlwaysOnTop, On, A----This works, however F12 cant be captured on the Client machine when the RDS is active (have to press ctrl + alt + home first)I need call information from the softphone passing to the RDS session , and click to dial to work from the RDS SessionI want to build the app initially as this job, but there will be further functionality development for it in future.So here is how it should work::- Requirements - We need 2 Executables 1 which runs on the client machine, 1 that runs on the RDS. RDS has an environment variable I have setup \"CLIENTIP\" The RDS instance should setup a TCP connection (to a specific port so I can allow on firewalls) to the client executable so they can send each other date / commands. For the rest of this explanation, I will call them RDS.exe and CLIENT.exe RDS.exe should constantly check to see if the CLIENTIP environment variable has changed (if they have reconnected from a new device) and reestablish the TCP link if it has. If the link cannot be established then it should retry every ~ 10 seconds until it manages to establish.RDS.exe and Client.exe should run in the system tray with a green icon if the TCP connection is established, and a red icon if not, right clicking the icon should have the option to exit or restart, but no other GUI is needed at this stage.- Function 1 - Softphone Access in RDS - If the RDS.exe see's the user press F12, it should send a request to CLIENT.exe to Show/Hide the softphone. When CLIENT.EXE receives this request if softphone is currently open as a a window, then it should minimise it. If it is currently not open as a window it should check if it is running at all, and if not launch it. Then if minimised restore it, and use Winset, AlwaysOnTop to keep it above the RDS session display.So effectively when someone is in an RDS session they can press F12 to toggle the locally ran softphone displaying above their RDS session, or minimising out of the way.- Function 2 - Passing Caller ID - When the 3XC Softphone client on the client answers a call it can open a URL which contains the caller ID (“Settings - Integration - Open Custom URL” on the 3cx system) We need to associate the URL with CLIENT.exe so it sends the callerID here something like ACAMIDDLEWARE:[REDACTED_NUM] . When CLIENT.exe receives this URL it needs to send it to RDS.exe and RDS.exe needs to save it to a plain text file on the user profile %APPDATA%\\ACAMIDDLEWARE\\LastCallAnswered.txt (so that our CRM software can look at this when it needs to for integration reasons).We will add further functions utilising this in later versions, but for the initial development this is all it needs to do.- Function 3 - Click to dial from RDS - On the RDS I will associate Tel: to RDS.EXE , when someone clicks a tel: Link on the rds then RDS.exe should capture this and send it to CLIENT.exe which will execute the tel: Link and dial the number through the softphone which is running on the client.- Future work - In the future there will be more work where RDS.exe can SQL lookup the number sent to it from CLIENT.exe upon answering a call and display a ‘toast’ popup with relevant information and links in it on the RDS desktop. However I’m not too fussed about making this work on this initial job we can work on that for version 2. There will be further functionality added in future too.- Development Environment - I want this project built in the latest version of Visual Studio using c#, and I want all source code and project files supplied, we will still utilise you for all further development, but I am learning c# at the moment and want to be able to make small changes myself and understand how it works.Please provide a quote and timeframe, feel free to ask any questions.Posted On: February 23, 2024 14:19 UTCCategory: Tech SupportSkills:Windows App Development, C#Skills: Windows App Development, C#Country: United Kingdom\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered are, moving, windows-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I bought a karaoke program. The program always goes to the Internet to the server and checks the correspondence of the hardware number and other equipment. That is, when launched without the Internet, the program will always be a demo. I asked the seller (who is also the developer) a couple of questions, to which he said “Are you kidding me? Watch the video.” I told him that it was not professional to provide technical support like that, and he wrote “fuck you.” I thought that he was rude, but I was not going to talk to him any further and would study the program myself.

(Software as a Service) that integrates automated messaging capabilities with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. This software aims to revolutionize how businesses manage data, communication, and interactions with customers and potential customers, maximizing efficiency and enhancing customer experience.The software will serve as a virtual assistant, capable of performing a variety of repetitive tasks that would otherwise require human intervention. These tasks include, but are not limited to, data analysis, sending initial messages, managing customer interactions, scheduling video calls, and providing personalized responses based on each customer's specific needs.A key element of this software is its ability to learn and adapt through the use of artificial intelligence. This will allow the virtual assistant to continuously improve its interactions with customers, based on past data and feedback. The goal is to provide a user experience that is as natural and engaging as possible, while simultaneously reducing staff workload and increasing customer conversions and satisfaction.The software will be highly customizable to meet the specific needs of each client company, allowing them to configure and train the virtual assistant according to their preferences and operational requirements. This translates into a versatile solution that can be employed in a wide range of sectors, from e-commerce to financial services, healthcare to tourism, and beyond.These conversation will all take place on the WhatsApp messaging system where all request from customers will be adressed. Whether b2b or b2c. The system will not include costs for sending messages but will exploit the WhatsApp API to ensure that chats open with the identity present on the customer’s WhatsApp Business.There must be an interface where it will be possible to connect the S.A.A.S software to other application through API such as social network or existing C.R.M.In summary, this S.A.A.S. software proposes itself as a cutting-edge solution for automated business communication management, combining powerful AI capabilities with an intuitive and customizable user interface, to revolutionize the way companies interact with their customers.Budget: $2,500Posted On: February 18, 2024 19:46 UTCCategory: Full Stack DevelopmentSkills:AI App Development, Artificial Intelligence, Chatbot Development, Machine Learning, APISkills: AI App Development, Artificial Intelligence, Chatbot Development, Machine Learning, APICountry: Italy\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered api-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.
