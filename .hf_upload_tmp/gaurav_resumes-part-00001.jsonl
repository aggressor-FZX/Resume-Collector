Project 2 company - PRGX [NAME] [NAME] description - company - PRGX [NAME] [NAME] description - [NAME]: 11+ Environment: Hadoop, HDFS, Hive, Sqoop, MySQL, [NAME] [NAME]:- [NAME] of this project is to store terabytes of information from the web application and extract meaningful information out of it.the solution was based on the open source s/w hadoop. The data will be stored in hadoop file system and processed using Map/Reduce jobs. Which in trun includes getting the raw html data from the micro websites, process the html to obtain product and user information, extract various reports out of the vistor tracking information and export the information for further processing Role & Responsibilities: â Move all crawl data flat files generated from various micro sites to HDFS for further processing. â Sqoop implementation for interaction with database â [NAME] Reduce scripts to process the data file. â Create hive tables to store the processed data in tabular formats. â Reports creation from hive data. Project 3 company - PRGX [NAME] [NAME] description - [NAME]: 15+ Environment: Informatica 9.5, Oracle11g, UNIX [NAME]: [NAME]. is an American global pharmaceutical corporation headquartered in [NAME] City. The main objective of the project is to build a [NAME] Repository for [NAME]. Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a [NAME] Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application. Role & Responsibilities: â To understand & analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries. â To design Informatica mappings by using various basic transformations like Filter, Router, Source qualifier, Lookup etc and advance transformations like Aggregators, Joiner, Sorters and so on. â Perform cross Unit and Integration testing for mappings developed within the team. Reporting bugs and bug fixing. â Create workflow/batches and set the session dependencies. â [NAME] [NAME] using mapping parameters, SCD and SK generation. â [NAME], reusable transformations to populate the data into data warehouse. â [NAME] & Worklets using workflow Manager to load the data into the [NAME]. â Involved in [NAME] Testing (UTC) â [NAME] Testing and UAT for SCD Type1/Type2, fact load and CDC implementation.
