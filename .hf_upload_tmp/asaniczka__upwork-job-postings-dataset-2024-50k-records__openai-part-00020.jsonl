My brand, ULTI Car Scents, sells premium car scents and I am looking at releasing a cool line of t-shirts to allow customers to support my brand. I would like the back design of the shirt to be a cartoon play of a person sitting in their car, looking like they're enjoying how their car smells. Perhaps you can give me some options, ie looking through the windscreen with a cartoon character smiling while scents are coming up. Use your creativity, but take inspiration from the WNDRR design. Be sure to include my brand logo. Fonts are: ULTI - Radley, car scents - Alike. My brand's primary colour is 1#42F2A - substitute dark green main logo and the text is #AC8B38 - bronze logo font.

Nie článok z wikipédie - mal by sprostredkovať všetky potrebné zaujímavé informácie tak, aby nevyznievali nútene)- Písanie poloformálnym štýlom ( Diváci sú väčšinou mladí a prichádzajú za zážitkom do spoločnosti, dôležitá je dobrá znalosť tónu a pridanie humoru a pridanie \"prízemných\" opisov zložitejších tém.- Dobré rešeršné zručnosti (Niektoré filmy sú nezávislou zahraničnou produkciou a môžu si vyžadovať viac prezerania (a možno aj prekladu a overovania faktov) ako zvyčajne, aby ste sa dostali ku všetkým informáciám.- Znalosť angličtiny a slovenčiny (ideálne aj ukrajinčiny alebo ruštiny) Keďže naše filmy sú vo väčšine prípadov zahraničné (neslovenské a neanglické), ďalšia znalosť iných jazykov by bola veľmi užitočná.Potrebujeme mať úvod, nie veľmi formálny, urobiť z toho trošku narrativny rozhovor o filme.Plánujeme robiť viacero takých premietaní a potrebujeme tento text ku každej. Čo sa týka dostupnosti filmu, vieme vám zabezpečiť jeho pozretie prostredníctvom stránky dafilms.com Tam sa dá za 2,50 pozrieť tieto filmy, viem to prirátať k cene alebo ponúknuť pozriete cez naše konto.Materiály ku filmu čiže články atď priamo k dispozícii nemáme, je to súčasť tasku urobiť rešerš o filme a režisére.O nás:Naše združenie sa snaží prostredníctvom filmov ukázať kultúru vybranej krajiny - cez oči ľudí odtiaľ. Je to hlavná pointa celého projektu. Aby ľudia si pochopili čo to pre tých ľudí znamená byť X kultúrou, a na akých problémoch im záleží alebo na aké dávajú dôraz.Zohľadniť tento cieľ projektu v rámci textu by bolo vhodné.Naše združenie sa venuje rôznorodým kultúrnym aktivitám a podujatiam pre cudzincov na Slovensku. Podporujeme aj charitu a z každého podujatia prispievame na humanitárne fondy. Snažíme sa ukázať silu umenie ako prostriedku na boj proti násiliu. Že každý umelec alebo fanúšik umenia vie tým odkomunikovať svoju pozíciu, prispieť k interkulturnemu dialógu a predísť aj predsudkam.Sme organizácia mladých ľudí a naši podujatia majú väčšinou komunitný aspekt, bez zvýšenej oficialnosti, a komunikácia je hravá a snažíme rozprávať voľnejším jazykom ako ste správne napísali. Táto \"lekcia\" by mala mať charakter rozprávania divákovi o filme a o okolitých informáciách. Chceme stále aby ťa lekcia mala prínos pre človeka ktorého zaujíma film ale aj pre obyčajného diváka. Proste nechceme robiť zo seba vedcov ale ani nechceme aby to bolo príliš zjednodušene. Hľadáme nejaký stred.Dúfam že tieto informácie vám pomôžu lepšie pochopiť o čom je náš projekt a naša organizácia celkovo :))Budget: $20Posted On: February 16, 2024 13:49 UTCCategory: Creative WritingSkills:Ukrainian, Russian, Slovak, Speech Writing, Film, Writing, Creative WritingSkills: Ukrainian, Russian, Slovak, Speech Writing, Film, Writing, Creative WritingCountry: Slovakia\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered sme, charitat, vna-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Hauptberuflich führe ich seit mehreren Jahren ein großes Team von Analysten und Data Scientisten, d.h. ich bringe einiges an Führungserfahrung mit und bin es gewohnt mit hochqualifizierten Menschen zusammenzuarbeiten, die super selbstständig arbeiten. Zusätzlich bringe ich knapp 6 Jahre Erfahrung im Online-Umfeld mit. Du kannst dir also sicher sein, dass das, was ich hier mache, Hand und Fuß und eine Zukunft hat und nicht in zwei Monaten wieder verschwunden ist. Wenn du dir einen ersten Eindruck verschaffen möchtest: Meinen IG-Account findest du unter fabian__kress. Anfragen zur Zusammenarbeit werden allerdings ausschließlich über Upwork beantwortet.Super, super wichtig sind mir Deutschkenntnisse, insbesondere schriftlich, auf mindestens C1-Level. Zum einen spreche ich ausschließlich deutschsprachige Kunden an, zum anderen spreche ich zwar gutes Englisch, habe aber in der Vergangenheit gelernt, dass es doch deutlich einfacher ist Mitarbeiter in der eigenen Muttersprache zu führen. Ich brauche dafür kein Zertifikat, aber verfasse bitte deine Bewerbung auf Deutsch und erkläre mir, wo du Deutsch gelernt hast und welche Erfahrungen du mit der Sprache hast.In folgenden Aufgabengebieten benötige ich Unterstützung:- Erstellen, einstellen und posten von Social Media-Beiträgen auf Instagram. Später ggf. auch TikTok (Beiträge, Reels & Stories)- Erfassen von Statistiken und darauf basierend den Content optimieren- Erstellen/überarbeiten von ManyChat Flows- Erstellen von themenbezogenen wöchentlichen Newslettern- Pflege von Kursinhalten- Unterstützung bei der Erstellung von Kursinhalten (z.B. Schneiden von Videos, erstellen von Audiodateien, ggf. auch Präsentationsfolien)- Recherche- Unterstützung beim Aufbau einer WebseiteSieh die Liste oben als eine Übersicht über die Aufgaben, die ich abgeben könnte. Was davon du am Ende übernehmen würdest, hängt natürlich auch an deinen Vorkenntnissen und wie gut du dich insgesamt machst. Ich bin durchaus bereit dir das ein oder andere beizubringen, möchte allerdings auch nicht bei Null anfangen. Solltest du komplett neu in den Themengebieten sein, sieh also bitte von einer Bewerbung ab.Im Laufe der Zeit können auch weitere Aufgaben dazukommen. Das können wir dann gemeinsam schauen.Wahrscheinlich macht es Sinn ein wöchentliches Meeting zu haben und sich ansonsten via Chat und Sprachnachrichten auszutauschen.Folgende Eigenschaften sind mir besonders wichtig:- Qualität- Zuverlässigkeit- Strukturiertheit- Selbstständiges Arbeiten- Lösungsorientiertes Denken- Professionalität- Nice to have: deine Zeitzone ist halbwegs in der Nähe der deutschen Zeitzone. Ich möchte ungern mitten in der Nacht aufstehen, um mit dir ein Meeting zu haben.Ich würde unsere Zusammenarbeit gerne mit einer kurzen (bezahlten) Probezeit starten und danach können wir gemeinsam schauen, ob es passt.Ich freue mich darauf dich kennenzulernen!Liebe GrüßeFabianHourly Range: $5.00-$11.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 19:14 UTCCategory: Social Media MarketingSkills:Social Media Marketing, Instagram, ManyChat, ActiveCampaign, Newsletter, Social Media Management, GermanSkills: Social Media Marketing, Instagram, ManyChat, ActiveCampaign, Newsletter, Social Media Management, GermanCountry: Germany\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hallo, mein, name-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Upon saving the workspace the code and workspace for the Blockly object will be saved to the database.Example input and output JSON will be provided upon request.Due to the time sensitive nature of the project, a requirement is experience in Blockly.

The speech must be intelligible.* The person making the recordings must have appropriate consent and rights to deliver the content to us. We will provide our IP/copyright and privacy statement that needs to be signed. We will verify this document. The verification takes 24 hours.* We will request you to record and provide samples. These files will help us assess the quality of the recording you will provide.* After we review and approve these samples, we will send you the contract and an NDA. The review will take up to 72 hours.* Once we send you the contract and verify your NDA, we will give you access to an application to upload the files you will record.* The audio recordings will be used to train speech-processing algorithms.CONTENT OF THE RECORDINGS:* We need 7 minutes of clean speech (i.e., we do not accept silence or noise as part of that 7 minutes unless there are a few seconds of natural speech pauses between sentences).* The content will be spontaneous or articulated speech and phonetically balanced sentences.* We are looking for 5 minutes of spontaneous or articulated speech, e.g., arguments, debates, kids explaining something, exciting or sad situations, and acting/drama. We will provide picture prompts for them to get inspired and describe or comment on these.* We will provide a list of phonetically rich sentences. The speaker will read them (2 mins) in both English and their native language.* The recordings must not contain personally identifiable information like names, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.* The recordings must contain only children's speech (not other people's voices).QUALITY OF THE RECORDINGS:* We only need studio-quality recordings.* We need you to provide 44.1kHz or 48kHz recordings.* The audio files must be saved in WAV or lossless flac format.* The speaker must use a wired headset or a studio microphone to record. Please set the recording quality to the highest available setting.* Bluetooth headsets or microphones are not acceptable.* Do not modify or use software to enhance, adjust, or edit the original audio file. Editing is okay only if you need to cut out unwanted parts (e.g., noise).* The speaker must record from a noise-free environment. This includes noises such as air conditioning, laptop fans, road noise, or other people talking in the background. We only need clean speech audio files.* Reverberant speech is not acceptable. Record in semi-anechoic conditions, e.g., a medium-sized room with carpets, things on the walls that absorb the sound, and soft furniture (e.g., sofa, armchair, etc).* If needed, please use a puff filter on the microphone.* Ensure the speaker does not play with or breathe directly into the microphone while recording.* Ensure the recording level is such that the captured audio is not saturated (so loud that it gets distorted).* The attached recordings are examples of the quality we expect you to produce. Listen to these samples and review the screenshots.PAYMENT:* We will pay $100 for 7 minutes of clean speech audio recordings.* We will submit the payment only after reviewing the audio files. The review will take up to 72 hours.* We will pay through Upwork only.* Only recordings meeting or exceeding the quality of the accepted sample will be paid for if they meet the minimum speech time required. We will not pay for partial deliverables.Important: Please review all the previous requirements and answer all the screening questions in this post before submitting a proposal.If you meet the criteria, submit your proposal attaching a 20-second sample that meets or exceeds the criteria (clean speech, WAV format, and 44.1kHz or 48kHz).Budget: $100Posted On: February 13, 2024 09:37 UTCCategory: Voice TalentSkills:Audio Recording, Audio Production, Voice-Over, Hindi, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, English, Voice ActingSkills: Audio Recording, Audio Production, Voice-Over, Hindi, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, English, Voice ActingCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered need, you, record-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a world-class tech resume writer. Transform weak, passive bullet points into powerful, metric-driven achievements. Context: General tech role"},{"role":"user","content":"Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"We currently have a customized desktop (or cloud-based) tool that pulls Amazon Pricing and other Product information for a given import of ASINs (with imports ranging from 100 ASINs up to 200,000 ASIN). We are hoping to connect with a Developer that is already using SP-APIs or has a sophisticated Scraping tool of Amazon data already in place.Or, if you are an experienced expert with APIs (particularly Amazon SP-APIs) or if you are experienced at Scraping (particularly, getting around Amazon's Capcha so that the tool would allow us to scrape price results for at least 150,000 ASINs every single day), then we are hoping to build a long term partnership with someone like you.If you are going to use SP-APIs we also hope to find someone that has an existing Amazon Seller Account that we can use (because we are already reaching our throttle limits throughout the day with our own account). In other words, we are hoping to somehow use your Amazon seller account if at all possible to download the results on an ongoing basis. Or, if you happen to know how to build this tool in a way that somehow processes 15,000 ASINs per hour, then we could use our own account going forward.The detailed specs can be found in the attached Excel file (please be sure to review the Excel file, as it contains more detailed Specs), which shows the desired output.Note that we already have a tool that works very well, so we can show you the output of that tool too, which is found on tab 2 of the attached Excel file. The problem is that the SP-API throttle limits only allow us to pull in the results for about 8 or 9 thousand ASINs per hour, and that is only half of what we need to reprice each hour. So we either need another scraping tool that generates similar results, or we need to use your Amazon Seller Credentials, or we need you to help us come up with a good solution so that we can essentially DOUBLE the number of ASINs that we process each day.General Description of the tool:We are hoping for an easy to use GUI that allows us to import a list of ASINs, and then will process selected pieces of Pricing using Amazons APIs. We already have an existing tool which works quite well, so if there is anyone who can lend us their SP-API credentials for their seller account, we would pay for that too.Basic Requirements:Tool should function similar to our existing tool, with the following features:(1) Import button (for given list of ASINs)(2) Ongoing Progress Bar which includes display of how many ASINs are being processed per hour(3) Button to cancel the process as needed. Also results should be accumulated in a CSV file or something similar so that if the computer shuts down (or automatically restarts) all of the downloaded results will not be lost.(4) Runs clean and easy on our Desktop computers (which use Windows 11).(5) ASINs will be for Active Amazon ASINs, so processing speed should be at least 8,000 ASINs per hour (preferably faster, somewhere near the maximum allowed rate by Amazon)(6) See attached Excel file for the list of Output fields, along with definitions. It is probably simplest if the Output \"Results\" file is automatically provided in the same folder as the Program (instead of requiring a manual export each time it is completed).(7) Ongoing support should be available for changes and tweaks in the years ahead, billed at a fair hourly rate(8) If this is an API app, please include a settings form option in the GUI to enter Amazon Credentials (i.e., Access Key ID, Secret Key, Amazon Username and Password etc) so that the app will work for our given Amazon account, or any other account that we try to use.(9) Please review the tabs in the attached Excel file closely, for a more clear explanation of how it currently works.Thanks very much. Look forward to working with you. We will be flexible, fair, and reasonable and welcome your input in terms of how to creatively design it so long as it achieves the same outcome. We hope to partner with you for an ongoing long term relationship in assisting with Amazon SP-APIs and other data scraping and automation needs.Budget: $400Posted On: February 22, 2024 23:09 UTCCategory: Scripting & AutomationSkills:API Integration, Scripting, Automation, Data Scraping, Data Extraction, Selenium, Python, API, API Development, RESTful API, eBay API, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Advertising Console, Amazon Web Services, Amazon, Amazon MWSSkills: API Integration, Scripting, Automation, Data Scraping, Data Extraction, Selenium, Python, API, API Development, RESTful API, eBay API, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Advertising Console, Amazon Web Services, Amazon, Amazon MWSCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Automated Excel workflows using excel, python, scraping, data extraction, automation, selenium, api, csv to create dashboards and custom macros, improving reporting speed and reducing manual effort for clients.
