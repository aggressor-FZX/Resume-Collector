Bought up by his grand mother, whilst his mother worked, he always had everything done for him, while his mother was making ends meet. He grew up in a modest household in China. Away from his father for a good part of his early child hood but needed his financial support. His father provided and paid for his son but didn’t have enough time to spend with his son as he was making ends meet himself across the other side of the world over in the Uk.

We require two distinct package box designs that serve as gift boxes, eliminating the need for additional wrapping.

When there is a surplus, it should increase the quantity of the final product produced by updating the production yield without affecting the quantities of materials used.*Add a button next to the loss button.Main Requirements:- Enable us to input the possibility of quantities exceeding 100% in production, meaning if we aim for 100 units and use 100% of the material, it turns out we manage to produce 105, allowing these 5 extra to be entered.-We need to apply an adjustment to our module in order to take control of the surplus. Currently, our system allows us to calculate a shrinkage of finished products. This means that while the material is consumed 100%, it does not manage to produce 100% of the final product due to defects or waste; instead, it only produces 80%. This allows us to close the production process and for the system to accept these differences. We need to apply this in reverse, that is, to use 100% of the raw material but in this case, to produce more than 100% of the finished product.-We can use the same shrinkage workflow, simply reversing it, so to speak. The button should appear as \"Surplus\" alongside the shrinkage button.Current Scenario: We use a combination of manual and automated tracking to measure production levels.Expected Improvements: We expect important upgrades in our tracking process.

So, I'm stuck before even getting started.I'm in search of someone who's got a good grip on Excel VBA to lend a hand. The task? To get this toolkit working without SHDocVw.InternetExplorer. Or, if you've already built something for a similar purpose, maybe we can adapt that to suit this project.I'm pretty comfortable with Excel VBA for finance and accounting tasks, but JSON and SOAP calls? That's where I draw a blank.

When there is a surplus, it should increase the quantity of the final product produced by updating the production yield without affecting the quantities of materials used.*Add a button next to the loss button.Main Requirements:- Enable us to input the possibility of quantities exceeding 100% in production, meaning if we aim for 100 units and use 100% of the material, it turns out we manage to produce 105, allowing these 5 extra to be entered.-We need to apply an adjustment to our module in order to take control of the surplus. Currently, our system allows us to calculate a shrinkage of finished products. This means that while the material is consumed 100%, it does not manage to produce 100% of the final product due to defects or waste; instead, it only produces 80%. This allows us to close the production process and for the system to accept these differences. We need to apply this in reverse, that is, to use 100% of the raw material but in this case, to produce more than 100% of the finished product.-We can use the same shrinkage workflow, simply reversing it, so to speak. The button should appear as \"Surplus\" alongside the shrinkage button.Current Scenario: We use a combination of manual and automated tracking to measure production levels.Expected Improvements: We expect important upgrades in our tracking process.

However, I need to log in a spreadsheet the team or player with the betting odds, and then update it again with the final score.Your first job is to find a way to provide scores for a team or player if given a day, a league (e.g. NBA), a team or player name and a statistic (e.g. Points). I will need to draw data for these leagues: NCAAB, NBA, NFL and MLB. Once there is a spreadsheet that can update this, we will integrate this into a new spreadsheet and move to the second job of importing my existing data into it. Finally, we will have to confirm that the spreadsheet is updating itself appropriately when new data is inputted.There is easily accessible data for all of these leagues, but require specific codes and date formatting to work correctly. So it makes sense that we have a solid spreadsheet that automates the most boring part of running sportsbetting strategies - data collection.If all of this works out, we can do the final task of building a worksheet that helps track bets, win rates and so forth.Candidate must speak English at a conversational level or better, and have experience with Google Sheets and/or Excel.

It is a deck of cards that updates traditional tarot with contemporary Millennial humor and wisdom. For example, the original tarot “The Devil” is \"The F&ckBoy\", “The Hermit” is renamed as “Off-The-Grid”, and “The Chariot” is “Van Life”. We've sold out twice, and now we're creating a much requested Gen Z version. I'm a Millennial, however, and need help coming up with the funny terms and writing the descriptions for a Gen Z themed deck.For those unfamiliar with tarot, people think of it as a fortune-telling tool or cards for psychics, but millions of people use it as a tool to analyze what’s going on in their life and it's become very popular among Millennials and Gen Z. I try to make it way more approachable by making it funny and relatable Millennial humor, and I want to do the same with Gen Z humor but need help.Please feel free to explore the deck and artwork in the current Millennial deck here www.millennialtarot.com/cards.Role & Responsibilities:* You'll receive a spreadsheet detailing the traditional 78 tarot card names and meanings alongside the Millennial name and descriptions for reference.* Your task is to create a list of Gen Z-related slang, expressions, archetypes, and struggles that encapsulate the essence of each card that could be used as the Gen Z name for that card.Benefits:* Hourly pay.* If all goes well, opportunity for contract to write the guidebook, as well.* You'll work independently, on your own time and relatively at your own pace. You are welcome to use me as a resource to ask questions, but do not need to.* I think it's a fun activity and really enjoyed doing it for Millennial Tarot!Requirements:* Deep familiarity with Gen Z culture, including but not limited to memes, slang, expressions, archetypes, humor, and struggles.* Interest and knowledge in spirituality and tarot is a plus but not required.* Many, but not all, of the cards are funny, so a sense of humor is also a huge plus.Let me know if this is something that would interest you and you feel like you could do a good job at. If so, I may ask for a writing sample, or give you 3 or 4 cards to come up with equivalent Gen Z names for as a trial for the whole 78.

The script is finished (with likely a few changes as we go), the songs are finished, and now we need to actually turn the screenplay into an animated film of the highest quality (standard length ~84mins).However, as we are self-funding this project (which we will then shop around), our budget is very limited. Although we would like to work it out so that we can put the whole thing together and have a finished product - we will also consider simply making a few select scenes/a trailer which can then be used to raise additional funds or, potentially just several still shots. There is no strict deadline, so it is ok if it takes longer to be completed as we make payments, for example.So far everyone involved in the creative process holds some level of ownership in the project. Ideally we would like someone who would like to join the creative team. So we are open to different proposals. Full partnerships (percentage of ownership), or a hybrid (part ownership with a smaller flat fee). If only doing a trailer, we would take the trailer to fundraise the film, with the proposed full budget cost to do the full film. As such, only the initial trailer would be on a hybrid or ownership model to help this get off the ground (lower percentage if this route). Once we had funding, we can continue to the full film according to the actual cost.We will need someone who works well as part of a team because we will want to be heavily involved in the design and animation sequences, as we have a good idea of what we want it to look like - with plenty of room for animator creative influence.Posted On: February 19, 2024 17:57 UTCCategory: 3D AnimationSkills:3D Sculpting, Animated Environment, 3D Modeling, Character Design, 3D Animation, Autodesk Maya, 3D Rigging, AnimationSkills: 3D Sculpting, Animated Environment, 3D Modeling, Character Design, 3D Animation, Autodesk Maya, 3D Rigging, AnimationCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered working, project, part-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
