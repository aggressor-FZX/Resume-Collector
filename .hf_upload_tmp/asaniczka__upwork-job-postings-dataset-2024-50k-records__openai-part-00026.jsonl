You can find more on YouTube just search for BrainChip.Our Akida IP is offered as a Licensing model plus a per component royalty.BrainChip offers a much different approach to AI computations. We lighten the computation load by only computing event-data, and also quantizing the bit count to the lowest possible size while maintaining model accuracy. Since our compute is on chip (within our IP) utilizing our integrated memory, our latency is very low. Our approach lends itself very well to applications at the edge, for example with the sensor on battery operated platforms. For instance, Akida IP only draws uW-mW (depending upon application) for inference at the edge.

I need a feature to help the customers find the perfect product or color match. Customers should be able to upload any picture or type in a color or rgb or hex-code and the tool should analyze all products in my shop and present all products with the same color.Details:After analyzing a picture the tool should offer an overview of all colors found on the picture. At the same time the tool should also show all the products with the colors found on the picture. If the customer then selects any specific color, then the tool should show only products matching to the color. A nice to have function would be to also detect the pattern and find matching products with same or similar patterns.Example:For example a woman uploads an image with a yellow dress with white dots on it. Then the tool should find all products in the \"exact\" yellow tone. If possible also with the same pattern, if available. Possible solution: a tie in the exact yellow macht with white dots on it.In addition to the exact match there should also be presented alternative matches with for example other yellow tones which come close to the original tone. Or with other patterns which come close to the original pattern. The tool should be looking nice. intuitiv and customer friendly.IMPORTANT!In your proposal please present me solutions you have in mind.

While I consider myself proficient in Webflow, my experience is predominantly with pre-designed templates.I'm contemplating a comprehensive revamp of our website to better accommodate new target demographics, refine our vision, and integrate additional functionalities. Given these aspirations and our reliance on Webflow, it's an opportune moment for a complete overhaul.I'm in search of a collaborator with the following capabilities:1. Mastery in crafting elegant, minimalist designs in Figma, followed by a seamless transition to Webflow, covering the entire design to development lifecycle.2. Expertise in copywriting is desirable, as I'm open to delegating this task, provided the quality meets my high standards. An adeptness in marrying compelling copy with visually striking Webflow designs would be ideal.3. Brand development is also on the agenda, despite having a preliminary vision for it. The Revolve template on Webflow ([REDACTED_URL] which includes a corresponding Figma file, could serve as a foundational reference.To give you a sense of the project's scale, the following elements are envisioned:- A homepage- Several contact pages- A blog section- A careers page- An 'About Us' section- Detailed service pages for our approximately 20 offerings- Pages for 5 distinct service packages- Dedicated sections for about 5 target groups- Industry-specific pages, ideally managed via a CMS to provide tailored viewpoints- Case Studies / References Page + CMSCurrently, we maintain individual pages for each service, a process that has proven to be labor-intensive. I propose we shift towards a more efficient CMS-driven approach, enabling easier updates to services and packages. I'm keen to hear your thoughts and suggestions on this.Looking forward to your applications, thoughts, and input.I will first collect the best applications before jumping on any calls. So don't ask for that in the first message.Hourly Range: $20.00-$50.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 04:25 UTCCategory: Web DesignSkills:Webflow, Figma, Web DesignSkills: Webflow, Figma, Web DesignCountry: Germany\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered greetings, team, the-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

I don't want to obtain a pure and simple description of the solutions adopted by the various countries of the European Union to deal with this issue, but rather a real study of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and a critical judgment on their consequences.I have a support folder, with some research already done, a pdf with guidelines, sample texts and, of course, I'm always available to help or discuss any topic.

The problem stems from the fact that Android drivers are incorrectly charging customers for mileage from the moment they accept the trip, rather than from the moment they officially start the trip by swiping on the app.Cause:This issue seems to be isolated to Android drivers only. When they accept a trip, the app mistakenly begins calculating mileage charges, even before the trip officially starts.Requested Fix:We need to ensure that mileage charges for customers are only incurred from the moment the driver officially starts the trip by swiping on the app, not from the moment they accept the trip.Hourly Range: $40.00-$70.00Posted On: February 16, 2024 17:26 UTCCategory: Mobile App DevelopmentSkills:Android, Java, Android App Development, Mobile App Development, iOS, JavaScript, PHP, FirebaseSkills: Android, Java, Android App Development, Mobile App Development, iOS, JavaScript, PHP, FirebaseLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered issue, description, noticed-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

We want to avoid potential note buyer’s seeing the name of the lender and every note buyer needing to sign the Bank’s NDA.- Once the NDA and Fee agreement are signed, the Note Buyer will be given access to all underwriting materials.

Currently in post-production, we hope to have a faster turnaround so we can submit to film festivals as soon as possible. That being said, we know work and art takes time, so we are flexible with the timeline and want the best product possible.Our film is an action drama martial arts film about two warriors who are in a secret relationship, both competing to become the leader of their clan of warriors. Once they are found out, their punishment, and final challenge to become the leader, is to fight each other in a Si Dou-- a death match. One winner, one loser.The inspirations for this film are Crouching Tiger, Kung Fu Panda, and Shang-Chi, with just a sprinkle of Romeo and Juliet. You as the artist will be bringing to life the opening prologue sequence, which will tell the story of how our main character came to the Totome clan. It will not be a fully animated sequence, but a stop-motion visual with only one or two frames per second. For visual reference watch the opening to Kung Fu Panda.Looking for artists with skill and abilities to do Japanese-style calligraphy that will fit the tone of the film, again kind of like the Kung Fu Panda opening.We are a small production with a smaller budget, but I am very willing to work with you to find a pay rate that fairly compensates you, while also not fully depleting our post-production budget.Feel free to reach out to me here, or my email [REDACTED_EMAIL] with any questions.Budget: $200Posted On: February 22, 2024 18:20 UTCCategory: 2D AnimationSkills:2D Animation, Animation, Character Design, Illustration, Traditional Animation, DrawingSkills: 2D Animation, Animation, Character Design, Illustration, Traditional Animation, DrawingCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered are, hiring, artist-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

This is made possible through our comprehensive Done-For-You services, designed specifically for those who may not have the necessary time or literary skills to write a book themselves. Among our unique services, we offer 'angel writing', a more affectionate term for what is commonly known as ghostwriting.We're currently looking to fill the position of an 'angel writer,' or ghostwriter. This role involves carrying out detailed interviews with our clients for each chapter, grasping their individual ideas, messages, and stories, and then writing the book on their behalf, effectively capturing their unique voices.We have an exciting client who is keen on publishing a book with us. Here's the fundamental idea of the book for you to review:Q1. Can you provide a brief overview of your book's idea?-Welcome to 100 Million Dollar Habits: My Journey to Success and How You Can Get There, Too. This is not just another book trying to sell you a grand idea, mainly because there are plenty of that already out there and I'm not selling anything. I have built my path in life, now I'm trying to help others see the reality of getting there is not a path that others can't achieve on their own. It's an invitation to join me on a journey I have undertaken myself, transforming my life through the power of daily habits. When you see the title, $100,000,000 I want to ensure you understand that it's not some get-rich-quick plan but rather share the key principle of consistency and showing up.Q2. What's your motivation for writing this book?-I have acheived a high level of success in my life and while many people think it's from a dental background (and I want to share a high level overview as a preface)Q3. What advantage or value will a reader gain from your book?-Not just talking high level points but actively sharing my own story and how it applied to me directly. First I wanted to do these things for 15 years and then share stories on how to get there. Once the book is written I want to use it as a template to create social media content to ultimately boost my brand.Q4. What style and narrative voice are you envisioning for your book?-Alex Homozi style - using lots of simple diagrams, stoytelling, and keep the reader at or below a 5th grade level to make it relatable to all.Q5. Lastly, what are your expectations from your Angel Writer?-To truly ensure they have read and understand the 2 core authors I'm trying to blend - James Clear and Alex Hormozi. I would like an angel writer who is familiar with their concepts, as I want to reference these frequently in our exchanges.Finally, the writing quality needs to be top-notch.---Understanding these answers will give you a clearer perspective on our client's vision for their book. We're keen to know why you believe you're the ideal Angel Writer for this project. Please elaborate on this point, as it could significantly boost your chances of selection!Your response will be presented to our clients, allowing them to gauge your book-writing abilities and determine whether they wish to collaborate with you.Helpful hint: Respond to these inquiries as though you're directly addressing the client. We anticipate building long-term relationships with our Angel Writers.Additionally, please share your insights about the client's book idea.Best of luck!

I am trying to make a viral tiktok or YouTube video.This is very straight forward. I want many people looking in to the camera and saying the word \"Mizunara\" in different ways. Surprised, amazed, excited, however you want, but with distinction! If you have an unusual look or accent that is great, male, female, young, old, we want everyone. The background should be blurred or not desecrating. There should be no other sounds in the video. If you like you can look at a glass of whiskey, or wine, or a cocktail.Please send the videos to me in both landscape and vertical format. These can and should be just a few seconds. Please only send your best.Background: Mizunara is a rare japanese oak. During WWII the US stopped trade with Japan. Japanese whiskey producers needed barrels and mizunara was the only oak that grows in Japan. Unfortunately, these trees must be 200 years old to make enough straight wood to create barrels. The flavor this wood imparts on the whiskey is amazing with rich vanilla and notes of sandalwood. I just imported some of this oak and it is the first time it has been available in the USA. Most people don't make whiskey but I want them to add some of this oak to boring bottles of spirits they have at home. It will allow people to improve spirits at home, making them exciting again. Hopefully, we will inspire wine and beer producers to also explore using mizunara. If we start a trend I want to create a mizunara flavored canned water. I currently make this at home and it is delicious.

I want to create 1 application that does all of it. This application will need to have many functions, but the general idea is:step 1. Create a posting schedule for 100 seperate accounts, spread out over the month. Where it posts, for example, 3 pictures a week, for the duration of a month. The bot should randomly generate days for when to post. The content that should be posted on each page, will be supplied through a csv file (or another format).step 2: follow/unfollow pages, like posts, comment under postsstep 3: send mass dms.The main part that is important is that this should all be completely automated. So all that I would essentially have to do, is provide a csv with 100 account logins, 100 folders with pictures/content, and the bot will automatically do what it needs to do without needing any manual work, through its algorithm.Posted On: February 16, 2024 15:27 UTCCategory: Scripting & AutomationSkills:Automation, Bot, Instagram, ScriptSkills: Automation, Bot, Instagram, ScriptCountry: Netherlands\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered automation, csv-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.

I am looking for some assistance with my wordpress website. I require a programmer who knows wordpress and is familiar with cloudways servers.I would like to change my existing wordpress website to a wordpress mulitsite. And add 3 subsites (existing domains I have)These subsites are also hosted by cloudways on the same server. I'm not concerned at this time about keeping any of the content on these subsites. The pages and posts from the primary domain will be copied over to the subsites. Then I will edit each site to give new branding and modify some of the content.Also, I will use the plugin WooMultistore to manage the woocommerce store on the subsites. Customers at any of the subsites would be able to login with their credentials from the primary site.I have not tested the WooMultistore plugin but, it looks like the right choice for managing the stores, inventory, and customers on the subsites. Once the subsites are created I will install the plugin and configure it the best I can. I would then ask that you be available for any troubleshooting if issues arise.When complete, the subsites will appear to any visitors that they are stand alone domains. Each subsite will use the Astra Pro theme with possible template changes.I would like to have a common media library that serves all the subsites as I do have a lot of images on the primary site and don't want to duplicate that.Also, when complete the permalink structure of the primary domain must stay intact. For example: [REDACTED_URL] or [REDACTED_URL] bought the domains thru godaddy and can provide all access needed.My primary domain and YouTube channel is broad in it's scope. With the subsites I'd like to narrow that down and focus on the content, items, and videos that have been most popular.Let me know if this is possible.Thank youKentHourly Range: $20.00-$40.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 19:08 UTCCategory: CMS DevelopmentSkills:WordPress, WordPress Multisite, WooCommerce, PHP, CSSSkills: WordPress, WordPress Multisite, WooCommerce, PHP, CSSCountry: Canada\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered hello, cloudways, customer-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}
