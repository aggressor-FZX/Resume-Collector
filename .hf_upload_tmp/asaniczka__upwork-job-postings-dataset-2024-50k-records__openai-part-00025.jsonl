The genre of the collection is Sci-Fi/Horror with a spin on technology in almost all of the stories - similar to Black Mirror or Twilight Zone. Kindle Vella only requires one image without text that will be cropped into a circle. Must be a JPG with 1600 x 1600 dimensions and not exceed 2 MB in file size.I'm looking for a creative image that will show a man sitting at a work desk (basically an author writing stories) with his face as a black hole instead of a human face. Maybe papers, pencil, VR headset, and other objects are flying around in the air around him. The idea is these stories are spilling out of my head that's actually a black hole. It should appear comical but also dark at the same time. Since the image will be cropped into a circle, the main elements should be closer to the center of the image. I've copied a few examples of other cover art on Kindle Vella to give you an idea of how it's crops. Bonus points if you can create some symmetry between the black hole and the circle crop.Please provide examples of your past work, especially if you have unique styles that you think would fit this project. The image you provide must not be created by any artificial intelligence generative software.Budget: $50Posted On: February 14, 2024 03:54 UTCCategory: Graphic DesignSkills:Graphic Design, Cover Art Design, Concept Artistry, Drawing, IllustrationSkills: Graphic Design, Cover Art Design, Concept Artistry, Drawing, IllustrationLocation Requirement: Only freelancers located in the United States may apply.Country: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered creative, cover, art-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

We can ignore prior to 2024 because it is so many entries. I’ve already asked if there is a way for ML to do this on the back end and the answer is no.- SDS Airstream- SDS Internal- SDS Employee Admin- SDS others?- Onbaording/offboarding?Figure out how to handle projects that are fixed fee and go over budget (i.e. tesla) from a reporting standpoint. I want to know in the margin report how we did.- I don’t want overages to look like ‘billable’ hours. This will give us a much better picture.- Maybe we have a ‘overbudget’ task that is always non-billable on a project and we can bill to that for fixed bid tasks. This would prevent the budget from going red and also prevent the margin report from getting all screwed up. (The margin report doesn’t seem to care if we go above the original budget, it just keeps adding ‘billable’ income to the project.- Can also manually mark time entries as non-billable in ML or make all tasks non-billable when a project goes over budget. I’ve put in a request to have this feature added or have a bulk modify feature added for changing a bunch of time entries to non-billable all at once.Figure out how to handle time off and sick days. Right now, they are showing up as ‘worked’ time in ML and they really are not. Ideally, they don’t show up in the ML utilization reports. The goal is to not have to download and manipulate data, if possible.- For Salary Employees- PTO should not show up in the utilization report. We can not track it, if desired. Or we can use the ML vacation tool.- Same with UPTO, although UPTO should not affect the monthly hours average in a negative way, so perhaps this will still need to be tracked in a project and show up in the utilization report..- For Hourly employees- PTO should not show up in the utilization report. We can not track it, if desired. Or we can use the ML vacation tool.- Same with UPTO. If someone isn’t working, they should just not fill out their timesheet. Hourly team members are not required to hit a monthly moving average, so this should be OK to not include in the utilization report- Unpaid hourly employee lunches shouldn’t show up in the utilization report, ideally. Perhaps we can stop logging it and just log the breaks? We could have them request it as vacation every day?- Solution is to create two or more groups:- SDS and Client Working Projects- Consists of all client projects and any SDS ‘work’- Does Not include PTO, UPTO, Sick, (or Unpaid lunches for hourly employees)- SDS PTO-UPTO-Sick-Lunch- includes PTO, UPTO, Sick, (or Unpaid lunches for hourly employees)- Once the groups are in place, you can run the utilization report with a Group filter for SDS and Client Working Projects Group and that will show you what you want to see.Hourly Range: $30.00-$60.00Posted On: February 14, 2024 17:53 UTCCategory: Business Applications DevelopmentCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered note, maybe, some-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

Some need recoloring, some need small redesigns to better match a common style.Ideally we would like to receive 30 unified design vector based + png images delivered.Attached file contains the 30 icons.The exact requirements:1. All icons should NOT have any shadow drops, some currently have it and it needs to be removed.2. All icons must be the same size, without any margins surrounding them3. While reworking the icons the colors, and color proportions (how much blue vs golden, and gradients) should be based on the icon called bat.png. All icons must have a unified color scheme. Some icons currently have different colors, they need to use the colors from bat.png4. All icons must be delivered optionally in vector format without any background and mandatory in png format without any backgrounds.5. There are some icons that are more complex, have more details. They need to be simplified. Again more similar to the icon bat.png.6. Stylistically the icons should avoid sharp lines and corners. The best styled icons currently are grape.png lotus.png and octpus.png. When redesigning all other icons please use stylistic inspiration from these images, specifically rounder more flowing lines etc. And color inspiration from icon bat.png7. The worst icons are crown.png, crocodile.png, snake.png, trumpet.png. Do not take inspiration from these and these will need to be reworked the most.8. Need to have some more significant difference between horse.png and unicorn.png in terms of style. Horse ideally should be as it is now, in a running, charging position, unicorn should be standing. That would make it different enough I think, altho recommendations are welcome.9. Some icons have weird body proportions, for example elephant.png is a little squeezed horizontally.

If you already have Type Monkey that would be best, or else I will supply a license.Budget: $50Posted On: February 18, 2024 20:55 UTCCategory: Motion GraphicsSkills:Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Video Post-Editing, Video EditingSkills: Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Video Post-Editing, Video EditingCountry: United States\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered straight, forward, task-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

To make sure we always have what people want without ending up with piles of things nobody buys, we use data—lots of it.Data helps us predict exactly what to stock up on. We do this by keeping track of everything happening on our app. For that, we use a tool called Mixpanel, which is like putting tiny sensors all over the app. These sensors tell us:* What products people are looking at by recording every time someone clicks on an item.* How popular each product is by counting the clicks and how often they're added or removed from shopping carts.* Where each product is popular, so we can map out the best-sellers in every city.* Where our users are, pinpointing the cities they come from.* When our app gets the most action, like the busiest times for views, cart adds, and clicks.We also want to know our customers as if they're friends. This means for every user, say John, we'll know:* His location, contact details, and what he likes to buy the most.* How much time he spends browsing different categories.* His shopping habits—what days and times he usually buys, how much he spends monthly and in total.* His app activity—how long he spends on the app, when he's most active, and how quickly he makes decisions to add things to his cart and check out.All of this information needs to be easy to understand at a glance, which is why we'll use charts and visuals to display it.Hourly Range: $20.00-$35.00Posted On: February 16, 2024 18:46 UTCCategory: Data EngineeringSkills:Data Engineering, Data Analysis Consultation, Mixpanel, Data AnalysisSkills: Data Engineering, Data Analysis Consultation, Mixpanel, Data AnalysisCountry: Canada\"\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"Delivered imagine, our, store-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients."}]}

The way it works is that people top up with local currency and then they can choose a room where they can play the game. The system matches them and gives the winnings to the winner.This is the website of the platformwww.playwinclub.comHere I detail more of what is needed- Develop the Web Version so that it is possible to run the APP from any browser by entering a link through the website- Create events like tournaments (With an event manager)- Be able to create events to raise funds through a tournament- When a crash occurs in Dominoes the game ends there- The last player who played (Only when it is a lock) that is, the one who won comes out first in the next round when this is not the case, the next one on the right comes out.- We will put the tables of 4 First in the games, 4,3,2- 2vs2 mode in Dominoes where the winning couple shares the prize- Revenge button at the end of the Game in ludo and Dominoes- Email Verification Code- Password reset code is not being sent- Expand Dominoes- Allowing the user to be able to see their pieces in Dominoes whenever they want. I don't know if it is easier for us to leave it on the purple button, or for them to always be able to see their pieces, which means that they are always there on the screen without having to press the button. morodo- Remove the \"X\" lock system in ludo- Check the problem when sending notifications to everyone- Users can see how many there are searching for a game in the rooms- That they can activate to receive notifications to play in the rooms- Lower the Domino points to 75 in games of two and 3 in games of 4, we are going to leave them at 100 points- Show user ID in Profile- Add BSC in the ad and USDT- Put a button or something on the website that refers or says that you can play online- Add the phone number to the verification when registering and if you are going to make a mobile payment withdrawal it must be to that same phone number, you must send a verification code to that phone number as well- Review the games that were stuck- When you search for a player in the administrative panel, for example, look for ID 20, it also shows me 1020 and 820, so you have to turn the page to get to 20, that is, you go from page 1 to page 2. When you do this, it takes you to all users lose the search for ID 20- Sound a toptop when the player passes in dominoes- Let a little sign appear that says pass and that the other player passed- The roulette wheel for the player to spin daily, with a free spin and coin prizes- Two users told me that when they play dominoes they have seen that the other player passes and although there are coins in the pot to steal, they do not steal, I don't know if this happens to me, but it would be good to review it.- We can put where it says Chips knows that a number comes out by counting the white rentangle chips referring to the back of the chips- Translate the word resynchronizing and let's say that the connection was lost, we are resynchronizing something like this so that people understand that their internet went down and that is why the game is being resynchronized.- In the store we are going to divide or put a sign that says Cryptocurrencies USDT and below for the contact us local currency because people are making purchases that they never complete because they simply give them to buy and that's it, but it's because they don't know- It occurs to me to remove the Telegram group and WhatsApp chat buttons to the main screen so that people can see them easier, it could be below the left- When we ban a player, do not let them enter the app anymore and put a message that says you have been banned or expelled for violating our terms, contact support and when you click on it, it takes them to the WhatsApp chat.

You should have a good grasp of Python programming language, including basic syntax, data structures, and libraries.2. SQL: For working with PostgreSQL, you need to have a good understanding of SQL (Structured Query Language).3. HTTP Requests: Understanding how to make HTTP requests to APIs is crucial.4. Authentication: You need to understand how authentication works with APIs. ChatGPT API requires an API key.5.
