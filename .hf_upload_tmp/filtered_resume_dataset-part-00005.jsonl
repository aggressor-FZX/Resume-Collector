The concept artwork is required to support the product design.The product:A set of glasses worn by an adult.The glasses will allow the wearer to see thermal imagery projected within the lenses using transparent OLED and prismatic lens glass. So the glasses will read their environment using cameras: one corner will have a thermal camera lens and the other corner will have a normal camera lens. The settings should have a symmetrical look, set within the top corners of the frame in an outward facing position.The arms of the glasses frames with be widened to accommodate thermal image camera circuitry and power pack, plus mucro usb charging socket.Initially we are looking for a virtual 3D model to be create, so that the model can be 3D printed whilst also being easily edited/adjusted to suit the component sizes that are sourced for prototyping. With this in mind... The concept art should be created in a CAD software such as one of the Auto desk suite of applications or similar like Blender. There will be a need for various file formats to be exported: DWG, VRML, DXF, OBJModelling the glasses as a 3d model will allow for adjustments to be made when more is known about component sizes based on the final chosen procurement deals.If you're interested in this project it might be worth knowing there will be others to create for in the future.I will update this brief with some sketches to support the project requirements soon.Budget: $80Posted On: February 16, 2024 23:02 UTCCategory: 3D AnimationSkills:3D Modeling, Autodesk Maya, 3D Rendering, Blender, Product DesignSkills: 3D Modeling, Autodesk Maya, 3D Rendering, Blender, Product DesignCountry: United Kingdom\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

How do spiritual innovators in the 21st century interpret and iterate on ancient wisdom to meet contemporary and future challenges? How can such evolving wisdom be made accessible to all who seek it in an increasingly global, religiously pluralistic, digital world?Following more than a year of research, Sacred Design Lab is producing a public-facing report on spiritual innovation worldwide. The project is funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation, which supports innovations that contribute to human flourishing. You can learn more about the project at this link. The audience for the report is spiritual innovators, religious leaders and institutions, funders, investors, and other potential partners looking to support spiritual innovation.Sacred Design Lab’s founding members were trained at Harvard Divinity School and have spent a decade working to map and understand the spiritual landscape in the United States, with a particular focus on supporting innovators. This is the first time we have expanded our research globally and we are eager to include artwork that reflects the spiritual lives of people around the world.Request for ProposalsWe are seeking illustrations for a public-facing report on global spiritual innovation, which will most likely take the form of a PDF document housed on Sacred Design Lab’s website. We define spiritual innovation as “A novel way to address spiritual longings that leads to flourishing people and planet.”We plan to commission six illustrations from artists in six different parts of the world on this theme. The design guidelines for your illustration are as follows:For the content of your illustration, respond to the question: What does spiritual innovation mean to you?Consider: Relationship between past and future, ancient wisdom and emergent technologies, religious traditions and lineage, creativity and possibility, soul needs of the present and futureIllustrations should be detailed, multi-faceted, and represent the individual illustrator’s style and point of view, while taking into consideration any art direction provided in terms of color, style, and sizing.We encourage you to draw on themes based on your personal experience and your own cultural and / or religious context.Approach/StyleHere are two previous reports by Sacred Design Lab for an idea of past approaches to the work: project 1, project 2. Some descriptive words for this project: Welcoming, soulful, spacious, expert but non-academic, some iconography, non-corporate, pathos not cutesy.Candidate QualificationsExperience creating professional quality illustrations.Must live in or have deep familiarity with a culture within one of the following regionsAsiaLatin AmericaAfricaEuropeMiddle EastOceaniaStrong communication, organizational, and time-management skills.Kind, collaborative, able to work independently.Proposal RequirementsIn an email or document please provide:Examples of your illustration work, ideally in context of a report or other written materialsResumeParagraph and sketch describing your proposed illustrationTimelineWe will select illustrators, one from each of six regions, for this project by February 19, 2024. Upon selection, each illustrator will be provided with art direction and any additional context. Illustrators are to submit their piece by March 1, 2024. Any feedback will be delivered to the illustrators within 5 business days. Final illustration and file hand-off will be due by mid-March, 2024.Budget and logisticsBudget for the project is a flat rate of $350 per illustration.To process your honorarium if outside the US, we will request a W8-BEN form, outgoing wire form, and bank authorization (if inside the US, W-9 form and ACH info)Selected illustrators will have their name, one-line bio, and website/social link included in the final report alongside their illustration.Budget: $350Posted On: February 15, 2024 21:34 UTCCategory: IllustrationSkills:IllustrationSkills: IllustrationCountry: United States\"\"", "source": "asaniczka__upwork-job-postings-dataset-2024-50k-records"}

It is about 120 pages.The narrator/ author is Mirth who acts as a alter ego for the author David Goodemote.Mirth is best known as an immediate, involuntary emotional response to a joke, sarcasm, or witticism. Even though spontaneity has been a hallmark of Mirth for centuries, Mirth is much more – he is the embodiment of devil-may-care, not concerned with the consequences of ignoring accepted conventional thought and behavior.Where medicine is involved, whenever Mirth has been needed, he has been by David’s side.While Mirth’s intervention has helped David through the potential difficulties of facing tough medical problems, it undoubtedly also contributed to a lack of caution to the point of fostering feelings of near invincibility on David’s part.Mirth did such a good job of patterning David’s health life to be not unlike that exhibited by Dorian Gray, that David often transported himself to a state of timeless disregard for his well-being.Cheerfulness is a habit, while Mirth is an unannounced flash of amusement. While David can enjoy the former, he cherishes the latter. That is why Mirth was selected as his mentor very early in his life.When David meets a new medical practitioner, the usual comment by that person is something like, “Reading your chart, I didn’t expect you to look so good.” David’s response is, “My chart seems like I should be taking my last breath, doesn’t it?”Mirth has written this book based on his own observations and the counsel he provided to David over time. David also provided his own uncompromising views for consideration by Mirth for possible content.I need someone who has produced an audiobook for Audible including voice, editing, and successful submission.

{"content": "Delivered summary, mum, bought-based improvements by transforming ad-hoc tasks into repeatable, automated processes that improved productivity and accuracy for clients.", "original": "Improve this resume bullet:\n\"\"Summary (TL/DR): mum bought an Atlanta house (as a canadian resident) added me to the house name via quitclaim in 2011 (either not both) and sold it in 2021. I created an LLC, transferred our ownership to the LLC partnership to allow us sell remotely but hadn't paid the taxes because the realtors only wanted to use only the sale price to calculate the taxes instead of all the costs and losses over the years. Unfortunately, many accountants said they’ve not dealt with a foreign owner and that is why I couldn't find an accountantLonger versionMy mum Laura bought a house in Atlanta in 2009 for approximately 95kIn January 2011Mrs Laura told me that she wanted to add my name just in case of any unforeseen event. She then did a quitclaim deed at the us embassy and a lawyer filed it in Jan 2011After many repairs and fixtures the house was eventually rented out around 2014.While many tenants gave headaches and eventually had to leave resulting in losses, the house got one long term tenant towards the end. All this time no taxes were filed. My mum told me around 2014 that she wanted me to have the house and that she won’t have any interest in it. In 2020 I decided it’s better to sell the house but was told it could not be sold as is. I fixed it and created an LLC and transferred ownership to the LLC (partnership) to enable the sale. In essence, even though her name was on the LLC when it was sold I will be the person to pay her taxes. But no matter the calculation, She already indicated that she was going to give me as far back as 2014 causing an added complication between when she indicated she would give me and the best time to effect this transfer due to the decline in property value([REDACTED_PHONE]) and losses from tenants.A few months later in March 2021, I bought a bungalow in ESL (east st. louis), Illinois for 33k and fixed many things in it but could not rent it till save for one person in March 2023- June 2023. This property also has costs/lossesThat's the general situation.
